Abstract,Title
"IN AN INDUSTRYFOURTH CONTEXT, TO EACH OBJECT A “DIGITALTWIN” IS ASSOCIATED, WHICH IS A VIRTUAL COUNTERPART OF THE OBJECT ITSELF. IN THE CASE OF A TOOL, THIS INCLUDES, TOGETHER WITH ITS MATERIAL AND MANUFACTURING INFORMATION, ITS SOLID GEOMETRY. TOOL GEOMETRY KNOWLEDGE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ENABLE EFFECTIVE TOOL MANAGEMENT, MANUFACTURING VERIFICATION, AND TOOLING SIMULATION. IF FOR TOOL MANAGEMENT THE CONVENTIONAL 2D PRESETTING IS SUFFICIENT, TOOLING SIMULATION AND TOOL MANUFACTURING VERIFICATION REQUIRE A COMPLETE 3D CHARACTERIZATION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN THE CASE OF THE MICROTOOLS: THE PROCESS OF MICRO-CHIP FORMATION IS STILL A RESEARCH SUBJECT. ALTHOUGH THE 3D GEOMETRY OF A TOOL IS WELL ESTABLISHED IN THE ISO 3002 SERIES OF STANDARD, ONLY RECENTLY 3D MEASUREMENT OF TOOLS HAS BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY NEW MEASURING SYSTEMS. STILL, TOOL GEOMETRY VERIFICATION REQUIRES A LOT OF HUMAN INTERVENTION. THIS PAPER AIMS AT SETTING THE BASE FOR THE AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS OF POINT MESHES SCANNED ON THE WHOLE SURFACE OF TOOLS, AND IN PARTICULAR MICROTOOLS. THE FIRST STEP FOR DOING THIS IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ACTIVE SURFACES OF THE TOOL, THAT IS THE FACE AND THE FLANK PLUS THE CUTTING EDGE. THE IDENTIFICATION OF THESE GEOMETRIC FEATURES IS IN GENERAL POSSIBLE THANKS TO THEIR SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS: IN PARTICULAR, THE CUTTING EDGE IS CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH CURVATURE, AND IT SEPARATES THE FACE FROM THE FLANK. THIS PAPER CONSIDERS CYLINDRICAL MICRO END-MILLS AS A FIRST EXAMPLE OF AN APPROACH THAT CAN BE EXTENDED TO IN PRINCIPLE ANY KIND OF TOOL. THE CYLINDRICAL HELIX CHARACTERIZING THE CUTTING EDGE IS THE KEY GEOMETRY TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPECIFIC METHOD. ONCE THE TOOL FEATURES (FACE, FLANK, AND CUTTING EDGE) HAVE BEEN SEPARATED, OF THE TOOL ANGLES, FOR INSTANCE, CAN BE ESTIMATED. AS FIRST ANGLE TO STUDY, THE RAKE ANGLE HAS BEEN SELECTED. THE APPROACH WILL BE VALIDATED ON SIMULATED DATA AND ON REAL SCANS OF MICRO-TOOLS. © 2020, INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR NANOMANUFACTURING AND TIANJIN UNIVERSITY AND SPRINGER NATURE SINGAPORE PTE LTD.",3D IDENTIFICATION OF FACE AND FLANK IN MICROMILLS FOR AUTOMATIC MEASUREMENT OF RAKE ANGLE
"THE DIGITALTWIN IS A RECENTLY DEVELOPED INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY IN INDUSTRYFOURTH. THE CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEM (CPS) IS A CONCEPT CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH INDUSTRYFOURTH THAT CAN FORM A BASIS FOR CREATING A DIGITALTWIN. IN THIS PAPER, A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL OF A DIGITALTWIN APPROACH FOR A MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT AND RELATED PRODUCTION PROCESSES IS PROPOSED. THE PRESENTED MODEL IS BASED ON COMBINING A 5-DIMENSIONAL DEFINITION FOR THE DIGITALTWIN AND CLOUD-BASED CPS (C2PS) ARCHITECTURE. THE MODEL CONSISTS OF FIVE LAYERS TO REPLICATE THE PHYSICAL OBJECT AS A VIRTUAL OBJECT AND TO COLLECT AND CONVERT DATA. ANALYSIS OF THE VIRTUAL MODEL FOR PREDICTION OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT, DECISION-MAKING, RE-CONFIGURATION, WHAT-IF ANALYSIS, AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN THE REAL TIME PROCESS IS PERFORMED IN THE FOURTH LAYER. THE USER INTERFACE LAYER IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE VIRTUAL AND PHYSICAL MODEL. USE OF A DIGITALTWIN IN MANUFACTURING ENABLES IMPROVEMENT IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LEAN MANUFACTURING, LEADING TO SAVINGS IN RESOURCES SUCH AS COST AND TIME. UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN MANUFACTURING PROCESSES MEAN THAT THE DIGITALTWIN APPROACH IS A MORE SUITABLE METHOD FOR OPTIMIZATION OF THE OVERALL PROCESS AND THE SUB-PROCESSES THAN PURE SIMULATION. AN ACCURATE DIGITALTWIN MODEL CAN IMPROVE SAFETY, SAVE COSTS, SPEED UP MANUFACTURING OF NEW PRODUCTS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW PROCESSES, AND PROVIDE GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION RESULTS. IN PRACTICE, HOWEVER, PROVISION OF DATA IS A CHALLENGE TO USE OF THE DIGITALTWIN APPROACH BECAUSE MODERN MANUFACTURING USES A VARIETY OF DATA IN DIFFERENT FORMATS WITH DIFFERENT OWNERS. ACCESS TO ALL REQUIRED DATA AND INFORMATION AND OBTAINING PERMISSION FOR ITS USE IN CREATION OF A DIGITALTWIN IS A TOPIC FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. © 2019 THE AUTHORS. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER B.V.

"FACTORIES ARE EVOLVING TOWARDS DIGITALIZED DATA-BASED ECOSYSTEMS UNDER THE PARADIGM OF THE INDUSTRYFOURTH WHERE NEW INDUSTRIAL SERVICES ALLOW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MORE ROBUST, RESILIENT AND CUSTOMIZED MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS. SUCH SERVICES (E.G., DIGITALTWINS, EXTENDED REALITY OR COOPERATIVE ROBOTS) WILL REQUIRE HIGHLY RELIABLE AND DETERMINISTIC COMMUNICATION NETWORKS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING STRINGENT LATENCY AND RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS. 5G NETWORKS AND THEIR FUTURE EVOLUTION HAVE THE NECESSARY CAPABILITIES TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, THE USE OF 5G IN INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRES ITS EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT INTEGRATION WITH TIME SENSITIVE NETWORKING (TSN), WHICH IS BECOMING THE STANDARD WIRED TECHNOLOGY FOR INDUSTRYFOURTH ENVIRONMENTS. TSN PROVIDES UNPRECEDENTED DETERMINISTIC SERVICE LEVELS WITH PERFECTLY BOUNDED LATENCIES. THE INTEGRATION OF THE INDUSTRIAL 5G AND TSN NETWORKS WILL BE KEY TO SUPPORT THE FLEXIBILITY AND DETERMINISM DEMANDED BY THE INDUSTRYFOURTH PARADIGM. A CRITICAL ASPECT TO ACHIEVE THIS INTEGRATION IS THE COORDINATION OF THE SCHEDULERS OF BOTH NETWORKS. TSN HAS INFORMATION ABOUT THE CAPABILITIES OF THE 5G-TSN INTEGRATED NETWORK, AND IT IS IN CHARGE OF DECIDING THE PATH AND SCHEDULING FOR EACH TSN TRAFFIC FLOW. THE SCHEDULING IN 5G MUST BE DONE ACCORDING TO THE SCHEDULING DECISIONS AND INFORMATION PROVIDED BY TSN TO GUARANTEE THE END-TO-END LATENCY REQUIREMENTS OF TSN TRAFFIC. IN THIS CONTEXT, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NOVEL CONFIGURED GRANT (CG) SCHEDULING SCHEME FOR 5G INTEGRATED INTO A TSN NETWORK THAT AIMS TO MEET THE LATENCY REQUIREMENTS OF THE DIFFERENT TSN FLOWS. THE PROPOSED SCHEME EXPLOITS THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY TSN ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TSN TRAFFIC TO COORDINATE ITS DECISION WITH THE SCHEDULING OF TSN. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE PROPOSED SCHEDULING SCHEME CONSIDERABLY INCREASES THE NUMBER OF TSN FLOWS THAT CAN BE SATISFACTORILY SERVED IN THE INTEGRATED 5G-TSN NETWORK COMPARED WITH A COMMONLY USED CG SCHEDULING SCHEME. © 2023 IFIP.",5G CONFIGURED GRANT SCHEDULING FOR 5GTSN INTEGRATION FOR THE SUPPORT OF INDUSTRYFOURTH
"AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE REAL ECONOMY, MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN THE WHOLE HUMAN SOCIETY. SMARTMANUFACTURING HAS BECOME A STRATEGIC ISSUE FOR MANY COUNTRIES. SMARTMANUFACTURING PUTS FORWARD HIGHER REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INTELLIGENCE OF SHOP-FLOOR PRODUCTION PROCESS, PRODUCT OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE, LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN, WHICH ARE INSEPARABLE FROM THE SUPPORT OF ADVANCED COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY. AS A NEW GENERATION OF MOBILE COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, 5G PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MANY AREAS OF SMARTMANUFACTURING WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGH BANDWIDTH, LOW LATENCY, AND MASSIVE CONNECTIVITY. THIS PAPER FIRST ANALYZED THE COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR MACHINE-TO-MACHINE, MANUFACTURING INTERNET OF THINGS, CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEM-BASED MANUFACTURING, LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN, INDUSTRIAL INTERNET PLATFORM AND DIGITALTWIN-DRIVEN MANUFACTURING. BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS, THE RESEARCH AND APPLICATION PROGRESS OF 5G IN MANUFACTURING ARE INVESTIGATED FROM THE ABOVE SIX ASPECTS.

"INDUSTRYFOURTH AND 5.0 APPLICATIONS WILL CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS SAFER, ZERO-DEFECT AND CUSTOMIZED PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS. SUCH APPLICATIONS (E.G. DIGITALTWINS, COLLABORATIVE ROBOTICS AND EXTENDED REALITY) REQUIRE COMMUNICATION NETWORKS CAPABLE TO SATISFY STRINGENT LATENCY, BANDWIDTH, AND RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS. SUCH REQUIREMENTS CAN BE SUSTAINED WITH 5G NETWORKS AND THEIR EVOLUTION THAT OFFER UNPRECEDENTED COMMUNICATIONS PERFORMANCE AND FLEXIBILITY THANKS TO THE SOFTWARIZATION OF NETWORKS AND THE USE OF NETWORK SLICING. NETWORK SLICING CREATES DIFFERENT LOGICAL PARTITIONS OR SLICES OF THE COMMON NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONFIGURES EACH SLICE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE APPLICATIONS IT WILL SUPPORT. RAN (RADIO ACCESS NETWORK) SLICING IS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF NETWORK SLICING IN 5G AS THE RADIO CHANNEL IS PRONE TO ERRORS AND THIS IMPACTS THE CAPACITY TO SUPPORT STRINGENT RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS. TO DATE, RAN SLICES HAVE BEEN CREATED CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF RADIO RESOURCES THAT MUST BE RESERVED TO GUARANTEE THE TRANSMISSION RATE OR BANDWIDTH DEMANDED BY THE APPLICATIONS THEY WILL SERVE.

"THE RAPID ADVANCEMENTS IN COMPUTING, STORAGE, COMMUNICATIONS, AND NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES HAVE ENABLED THE CREATION OF DIGITALTWINS (DTS). A DT IS A DIGITAL REPRESENTATION OF A REAL-WORLD PHYSICAL COMPONENT, PRODUCT, OR EQUIPMENT. A DT CAN BE USED FOR 3-D DESIGN, TESTING, SIMULATION, AND PROTOTYPING PRIOR TO THE MANUFACTURING OF THE PHYSICAL COMPONENT. ONCE A PHYSICAL COMPONENT IS IN OPERATION, A DT CAN BE USED FOR CONFIGURATION, MONITORING, DIAGNOSTICS, AND PROGNOSTICS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT DTS WILL GAIN SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, AND WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN INDUSTRYFOURTH. HOWEVER, TODAY'S APPROACHES, SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGIES LEVERAGED FOR THE CREATION OF DTS ARE MOSTLY CENTRALIZED AND FALL SHORT OF PROVIDING TRUSTED DATA PROVENANCE, AUDIT, AND TRACEABILITY. ALSO, DATA RELATED TO TRANSACTIONS, LOGS, AND HISTORY ARE NOT SECURE OR TAMPER-PROOF. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A BLOCKCHAIN-BASED CREATION PROCESS OF DTS TO GUARANTEE SECURE AND TRUSTED TRACEABILITY, ACCESSIBILITY, AND IMMUTABILITY OF TRANSACTIONS, LOGS, AND DATA PROVENANCE. OUR PROPOSED APPROACH USES SMART CONTRACTS TO GOVERN AND TRACK TRANSACTIONS INITIATED BY PARTICIPANTS INVOLVED IN THE CREATION OF DTS. OUR APPROACH ALSO EMPLOYS DECENTRALIZED STORAGE OF INTERPLANETARY FILE SYSTEMS TO STORE AND SHARE DTS DATA. MOREOVER, WE PRESENT DETAILS ON OUR SYSTEM DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE, IMPLEMENTATION, AND ALGORITHMS. FURTHERMORE, WE PROVIDE SECURITY AND COST ANALYSIS, AND SHOW HOW OUR APPROACH FULFILLS THE REQUIREMENTS OF DTS PROCESS CREATION.

"AIRCRAFT SPARE PARTS INVENTORY MANAGEMENT (ASPM) HAS PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN TRACING AND TRACKING SPARE PARTS AS ANY RELATED MAINTENANCE OR MOVEMENT SHALL BE RECORDED. TRACEABILITY AND TRACKABILITY OF DATA ENSURE THE COMPLIANCE OF AIRWORTHINESS REQUIREMENTS. THE INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION (IATA) HAS STRONGLY EMPHASISED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF QUALITY TRACEABILITY DATA THROUGHOUT THE AIRCRAFT PART'S LIFE CYCLE, LEADING TO ENHANCED INVENTORY CONTROL ACCURACY, REDUCED MAINTENANCE ERROR, AND EFFECTIVE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES. HOWEVER, WITH THE RAPID INCREASE OF SPARE PARTS TYPES, THE COMPLEXITY OF AIRCRAFT PARTS MULTI-STAGE SUPPLY CHAINS LEADS TO INEFFICIENT TRACING AND TRACKING OPERATIONS WITH UNSATISFACTORY TRACEABILITY DATA QUALITY AND INFORMATION SECURITY.

"DIGITALTWINS IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS ENABLE A STRUCTURED AND UNIFORM ACCESS TO DISTRIBUTED ASSET-RELATED DATA, FUNCTIONALITIES AND MODELS, WHICH CAN BE LEVERAGED BY APPLICATIONS TO ACHIEVE A SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENT OF THE MANUFACTURING SYSTEM. HOWEVER, PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS ARE COMPLEX AND CONTAIN VARIOUS HETEROGENEOUS AND HIGHLY INTERRELATED ASSET TYPES, MAKING ITS DIGITAL REPRESENTATION THROUGH DIGITALTWINS DIFFICULT AND AMBIGUOUS. GIVEN THIS SITUATION, WE INTRODUCE A CONCEPT FOR A STRUCTURED IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITALTWINS IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS USING THE ASSET ADMINISTRATION SHELL (AAS). FIRST, RELEVANT TYPES OF PRODUCTION ASSETS, WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN AAS, ARE DERIVED. IN THE NEXT STEP, THE IDENTIFIED ASSET TYPES ARE CHARACTERIZED, RELATIONSHIPS ARE DEFINED AND THUS A COHERENT CONCEPT FOR THE DIGITAL REPRESENTATION OF PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS IS CREATED. FINALLY, AN APPROACH FOR APPLYING THE CONCEPT IN HIGH-VOLUME PRODUCTION IS DESCRIBED. WE THEN VALIDATE OUR APPROACH CONCEPTUALLY USING THE EXAMPLE OF A LAB-SCALE PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT FOR BATTERY CELL MANUFACTURING.

"WITH THE INDUSTRYFOURTH REVOLUTION CURRENTLY UNDERWAY, MANUFACTURING COMPANIES ARE MASSIVELY ADOPTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO ACHIEVE THE VIRTUALIZATION OF THEIR SHOP FLOOR AND THE COLLABORATION OF THEIR INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THIS PROCESS OFTEN LEADS TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF A REAL-TIME, COLLABORATIVE, AND INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL FACTORY OF THEIR PHYSICAL FACTORY (SO-CALLED DIGITALTWIN). THE APPLICATION OF DIGITALTWINS AND FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES IN PRODUCTION PLANNING STILL FACES MANY CHALLENGES. BUT THE RESEARCH IS STILL LIMITED ABOUT HOW THESE FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE APPLIED TO ENHANCE PRODUCTION PLANNING. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES HOW TO ENHANCE MATERIAL RESOURCE PLANNING (MRP) WITH DIGITALTWINS AND OTHER FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES, AND PRESENTS A FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTEGRATION OF MRP SOFTWARE WITH DIGITALTWIN TECHNOLOGIES. INDEED, THE DATA COLLECTED FROM THE SHOP FLOOR CAN IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THE OPTIMIZATION MODELS USED IN THE MRP SOFTWARE. FIRST, SEVERAL MRP PARAMETERS ARE UNKNOWN WHEN PLANNING, AND SOME OF THESE PARAMETERS MAY BE ACCURATELY FORECASTED FROM THE DATA WITH MACHINE LEARNING. NEVERTHELESS, THE FORECAST WILL NEVER BE PERFECT, AND THE VARIABILITY OF SOME PARAMETERS MAY HAVE A CRITICAL IMPACT ON THE RESULTING PLAN. THEREFORE, THE OPTIMIZATION APPROACH MUST PROPERLY ACCOUNT FOR THESE UNCERTAINTIES, AND SOME METHODS MUST ALLOW BUILDING PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION FROM THE DATA. SECOND, AS THE OPTIMIZATION MODELS IN MRP ARE BASED ON AGGREGATED DATA, THE RESULTING PLANS ARE USUALLY NOT IMPLEMENTABLE IN PRACTICE.

"SMARTMANUFACTURING, AS AN EMERGING MANUFACTURING PARADIGM, LEVERAGES MASSIVE IN-CONTEXT DATA FROM MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS FOR INTELLIGENT DECISION MAKINGS. IN SUCH CONTEXT, CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS) PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DIGITIZING MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS AND INTEGRATING MULTIPLE SYSTEMS TOGETHER FOR COLLABORATIVE WORKS. AMONGST DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SMARTNESS AND CONNECTEDNESS OF CPS, DIGITALTWIN (DT), AS AN EXACT DIGITAL COPY OF A PHYSICAL OBJECT OR SYSTEM INCLUDING ITS PROPERTIES AND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ENVIRONMENT, HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON REALIZING SMARTMANUFACTURING. A DT CONSTANTLY SYNCHRONIZES WITH ITS PHYSICAL SYSTEM AND PROVIDES REAL-TIME HIGH-FIDELITY SIMULATIONS OF THE SYSTEM AND OFFERS UBIQUITOUS CONTROL OVER THE SYSTEM. DESPITE ITS GREAT ADVANTAGES, FEW WORKS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED ABOUT DT REFERENCE MODELS, LET ALONE A GENERIC MANNER TO ESTABLISH IT FOR SMARTMANUFACTURING.

THE TRANSLATION OF A GRAPH-BASED MODEL INTO A SIMULATION SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENT NECESSITATES THE USE OF SIMULATOR-SPECIFIC MAPPING RULES. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES AN APPROACH FOR GENERATING A DIGITALTWIN BASED ON A STEADY STATE SIMULATION MODEL, USING A PIPING AND INSTRUMENTATION DIAGRAM (P&ID) AS THE MAIN SOURCE OF INFORMATION. THE STEADY STATE MODELING PARADIGM IS ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR USE CASES INVOLVING RETROFITS FOR AN OPERATIONAL PROCESS PLANT, ALSO KNOWN AS A BROWNFIELD PLANT. A METHODOLOGY AND TOOLCHAIN IS PROPOSED, CONSISTING OF MANUAL, SEMI-AUTOMATED AND FULLY AUTOMATED STEPS. A PILOT SCALE BROWNFIELD FIBER PROCESSING PLANT WAS USED AS A CASE STUDY TO DEMONSTRATE OUR PROPOSED METHODOLOGY AND TOOLCHAIN, AND TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS ISSUES THAT MAY NOT OCCUR IN LABORATORY SCALE CASE STUDIES.

"DIGITALTWIN (DT) IS AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS RECENTLY BEEN CITED AS AN UNDERPINNING ELEMENT OF THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION. DTS ARE COMMONLY DEFINED AS DIGITAL REPLICAS OF COMPONENTS, SYSTEMS, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES THAT RECEIVE DATA FROM THE FIELD TO SUPPORT INTELLIGENT DECISION-MAKING. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL FRAMEWORKS FOR DT APPLICATION IN MANUFACTURING HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, THERE IS NO SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY IN THE LITERATURE THAT SUPPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCALABLE, REUSABLE, INTEROPERABLE, INTERCHANGEABLE, AND EXTENSIBLE DT SOLUTIONS, WHILE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SPECIFIC MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT NEEDS AND CONDITIONS. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES A DT SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY AS A GENERIC PROCEDURE FOR ANALYZING AND DEVELOPING DTS FOR MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS. THE METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON THE WELL-KNOWN SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC) PROCESS AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION: (1) THE SPECIFICITY OF DT CHARACTERISTICS AND REQUIREMENTS, (2) AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MANUFACTURING CONTEXT IN WHICH THE DTS WILL OPERATE, AND (3) THE OBJECT-ORIENTED ASPECTS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE DT CAPABILITIES OF SCALABILITY, REUSABILITY, INTEROPERABILITY, INTERCHANGEABILITY, AND EXTENSIBILITY.

FOR RAPID AND STABLE MOTION PLANNING FOR HUMANOID ROBOTS, MULTITASKING-ORIENTED TRAINING USING THE TWIN SYNCHRO-CONTROL (TSC) SCHEME WITH DRL IS PROPOSED. FOR SWITCHING BETWEEN TASKS, THE ROBOT ARM TRAINING MUST BE QUICK AND DIVERSE. IN THIS WORK, AN APPROACH FOR OBTAINING A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE AS INPUT TO DRL IS DEVELOPED AND VERIFIED USING SIMULATIONS. TWO SIMPLE EXAMPLES ARE DEVELOPED IN A SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT. WE DEVELOPED A DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM TO GENERATE ANGLE DATA EFFICIENTLY AND AUTOMATICALLY. THESE DATA ARE USED TO IMPROVE THE REWARD FUNCTION OF THE DEEP DETERMINISTIC POLICY GRADIENT (DDPG) AND QUICKLY TRAIN THE ROBOT FOR A TASK. THE APPROACH IS APPLIED TO A MODEL OF THE HUMANOID ROBOT BHR-6, A HUMANOID ROBOT WITH MULTIPLE-MOTION MODE AND A SOPHISTICATED MECHANICAL STRUCTURE. USING THE POLICIES TRAINED IN THE SIMULATIONS, THE HUMANOID ROBOT CAN PERFORM TASKS THAT ARE NOT POSSIBLE TO TRAIN WITH EXISTING METHODS. THE TRAINING IS FAST AND ALLOWS THE ROBOT TO PERFORM MULTIPLE TASKS. OUR APPROACH UTILIZES HUMAN JOINT ANGLE DATA COLLECTED BY THE DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF A SPARSE REWARD IN DRL FOR TWO SIMPLE TASKS.

DESPITE THE AVAILABILITY OF HIGH DIMENSIONAL MANUFACTURING DATA, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME IS STILL SPENT ON TESTING THE END PRODUCTS. THEREFORE, WITH A DRIVE TO SUBSTITUTE THESE INSPECTION PROCESSES WITH A “DIGITALTWIN”, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A FRAMEWORK FOR PREDICTING THE OPTIMAL SURFACE METROLOGY PARAMETERS SUCH AS FORCE AND VIBRATION, REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED SURFACE ROUGHNESS OF AN END PRODUCT. FIRSTLY, AN ADAPTIVE NEURO-FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM (ANFIS) WAS DESIGNED TO PREDICT THE SURFACE ROUGHNESS USING VIBRATION, FORCE AND TEMPERATURE. A LOW RMSE OF 0.07 WAS OBTAINED BETWEEN THE PREDICTED AND DESIRED SURFACE ROUGHNESS. THIS MODEL WAS THEN REVERSE ENGINEERED TO PREDICT THE OPTIMAL SURFACE CONDITIONS (FORCE, VIBRATION AND TEMPERATURE) REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED SURFACE ROUGHNESS. FOR THIS, OPTIMISATION WAS APPLIED TO MINIMISE THE ERROR BETWEEN THE TARGET AND PREDICTED SURFACE ROUGHNESS.

"IN THE ERA OF INDUSTRYFOURTH, RESEARCHERS IN VARIOUS FIELDS HAVE PAID SPECIAL ATTENTION TO DIGITALTWIN TECHNOLOGY, WHICH CAN REALIZE REAL-TIME MAPPING BETWEEN VIRTUAL AND PHYSICAL SPACE. IN THIS PAPER, A NEW GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR RESPONSE PREDICTION OF COMPOSITE STRUCTURES BASED ON DIGITALTWINS IS PROPOSED. THE TENSILE TESTING PROCESS OF STANDARD SAMPLES OF CARBON FIBER-REINFORCED COMPOSITES (CFRCS) IS USED AS THE TWINNING OBJECT. MOREOVER, THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DIGITALTWIN AND COMPOSITE STRUCTURAL RESPONSE PREDICTION BASED ON THE GENERIC FRAMEWORK IS DEMONSTRATED. FIRST, STANDARD CFRC TENSILE SAMPLES ARE PREPARED, AND RELEVANT RAW DATA ARE ACQUIRED. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE MICROSCOPIC PARAMETERS OF THE STANDARD CFRC TENSILE SAMPLES ARE OBTAINED BY SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. GEOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS ARE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE MACROSCOPIC PARAMETERS, WHICH, TOGETHER WITH THE MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF CARBON FIBERS AND MATRIX, ARE USED AS THE INPUT PARAMETERS OF A MULTI-SCALE VIRTUAL PHYSICAL MODEL (MVPM). THE MVPM IS USED TO SIMULATE THE ACTUAL TENSILE PROCESS USING THE MULTI-SCALE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD (FEM). THEN, THE REAL-TIME MEASUREMENT DATA FROM THE PHYSICAL SPACE ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE VIRTUAL SPACE THROUGH SENSORS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE COMPUTATIONALLY TIME-CONSUMING MVPM IS DOWNSCALED TO MEET THE REAL-TIME REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ONLINE DEPLOYMENT OF THE DIGITALTWINS. IN THIS PAPER, THE BACKPROPAGATION (BP) NEURAL NETWORK MODEL IS USED TO TRAIN THE INPUT AND OUTPUT PARAMETER DATA OF THE MVPM TO OBTAIN A REDUCED-ORDER MODEL (ROM). IN ADDITION, TO IMPROVE THE PREDICTION ACCURACY OF THE STRUCTURAL RESPONSE OF THE DIGITALTWIN, THREE MODEL UPDATE STRATEGIES (MUS) OF THE ROM ARE PROPOSED: 1) MUS 1 IS BASED ON THE ROM, ADDING THE TESTED SAMPLE HISTORICAL DATA FOR THE TRAINING MODEL UPDATE STRATEGY; 2) MUS 2 IS BASED ON THE ROM 1, ADDING THE MEASURED REAL-TIME DATA OF THE CURRENT SAMPLE FOR TRAINING AND UPDATING TO OBTAIN THE ROM 2; 3) MUS 3 IS BASED ON THE PREDICTED STRUCTURAL RESPONSE DATA OF ROM 2. COMBINED WITH THE REAL-TIME MEASURED DATA OF THE CURRENT SAMPLE, A HIGHER-ORDER FITTING REAL-TIME CORRECTION IS PERFORMED TO OBTAIN ROM 3. FINALLY, THE TENSILE PROCESS OF FIVE CFRC STANDARD SAMPLES IS DEMONSTRATED BASED ON THE STRUCTURAL RESPONSE PREDICTION OF THE DIGITALTWIN. THE STRAIN RESPONSE PREDICTION AND CONTOUR VISUALIZATION OF THE WHOLE SAMPLE IS ACHIEVED WITH LIMITED STRAIN GAUGE DATA. BY COMPARISON, MUS 2 HAS HIGHER PREDICTION ACCURACY THAN MUS 1 AFTER ADDING THE REAL-TIME MEASURED DATA OF THE CURRENT SAMPLE.

THE RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS CYBER-PHYSICAL PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, INDUSTRIAL INTERNET OF THINGS, AND BIG MANUFACTURING DATA ANALYTICS HAS EMPOWERED THE DIGITALIZATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND PROMOTED THE CONCEPT OF DIGITALTWIN (DT). AS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES FOR INDUSTRYFOURTH, DT ENABLES THE CONVERGENCE BETWEEN A PHYSICAL SYSTEM AND ITS DIGITAL REPRESENTATION. DT MODELLING IS THE BASIS OF IMPLEMENTING DT IN PRACTICE. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A DT MODELLING METHOD BASED ON A MULTI-AGENT ARCHITECTURE. IT FOCUSES ON QUALITY CONTROL DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND PROVIDES SOLUTIONS TO GATHER RELEVANT INFORMATION AND ANALYZE THE CORRESPONDING INFLUENCES ON PRODUCT QUALITY.

HOWEVER, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY FACES SEVERAL COMPLEX PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN PHYSICAL ENTITIES AND THEIR VIRTUAL COUNTERPARTS, AS WELL AS TO THE LOGICAL REASONING BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS CONSTITUTING THE DIGITALTWIN. IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT AN APPROACH BASED ON DIGITALTWINS AND ONTOLOGIES IS PROPOSED. THE ORIGINALITY OF THIS PAPER LIES IN TWO IMPORTANT POINTS: THE FIRST IS THE EXPLOITATION OF THE EXPRESSIVENESS AND REASONING CAPABILITIES OF ONTOLOGIES TO SOLVE CYBER-PHYSICAL INTEROPERABILITY PROBLEMS AT THE DIGITALTWIN LEVEL, WHILE THE SECOND IS THE AUTOMATION OF THE WHOLE MAINTENANCE PROCESS AND ITS DECISION MAKING KEY POINTS USING THE INFERENCE POTENTIALITIES OF ONTOLOGIES.

"IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE OPTIMAL STATE OF RECOVERED MOLDING SAND INSIDE A FOUNDRY, IT IS NECESSARY TO AVOID TEMPERATURE PEAKS AND TO ENSURE OPTIMAL HUMIDITY CONDITIONS PRIOR TO REUSING THE SAND. SAND THAT IS TOO HOT OR WITHOUT OPTIMAL MOISTURE CAN CAUSE PRODUCTION DELAYS DUE TO A LONG MIXING PROCESS, EXCESSIVE CONSUMPTION OF RAW MATERIALS, OR POOR AGGLUTINATION. TO ENSURE A STABLE AND OPTIMAL SAND TEMPERATURE, MANY FOUNDRIES CHOOSE TO INCORPORATE COOLERS INTO THEIR PROCESS, HOWEVER, IT IS A SOLUTION THAT IS NOT ALWAYS VIABLE, EITHER DUE TO THEIR HIGH COST OR A LACK OF SPACE WITHIN THE FACILITY. ANOTHER SOLUTION IS TO INCORPORATE WATER SPRINKLERS INTO THE COOLING DRUM WHICH CONTRIBUTE BY REDUCING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CASTINGS AND THE SAND, BUT THESE SYSTEMS DO NOT PREVENT TEMPERATURE PEAKS FROM OCCURRING. THEREFORE, HERE, WE PRESENT A CONTROL METHODOLOGY, BASED ON A DIGITAL ARCHITECTURE THAT, GOVERNED BY AN INTELLIGENT DIGITALTWIN ALLOWS US TO KNOW THE REAL SITUATION AND THE CURRENT RATE OF PRODUCTION, PROVIDING SUGGESTIONS FOR WATER ADDITION.

USUALLY SUCH DATA CONTAIN RELEVANT INFORMATION, WHICH CAN BE USED TO MONITOR AND ANALYZE THE PROCESSES, BUT ALSO IMPROVE THEM, APPLYING OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES THAT ALLOW TO ENHANCE DIFFERENT ASPECTS, SUCH AS MACHINE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING, PRODUCT QUALITY, USE OF RESOURCES AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. THE DIGITALTWIN (DT) CONCEPT HAS BEEN RECENTLY APPLIED IN THE CONTEXT OF INDUSTRYFOURTH, TO EXPLOIT THIS DATA, LEVERAGING ADVANCED PHYSICAL MODELLING, DATA ANALYSIS, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) ALGORITHMS FOR OPTIMIZATION AND PREDICTION, WHICH ARE TWO KEY CONCEPTS IN THE INDUSTRYFOURTH PARADIGM. CURRENTLY, THE MAJOR CHALLENGE IN THIS FIELD IS TO MAKE THESE TECHNIQUES AVAILABLE FOR THE INDUSTRIES AND ENSURE THEIR EASE OF USE FOR THE FINAL USERS.

"DIGITALTWIN AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TECHNOLOGIES ARE CONSIDERED KEY ENABLERS FOR INDUSTRYFOURTH AND SUSTAINABLE INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING. THE USAGE OF DIGITALTWINS IN MANUFACTURING PROCESSES LEADS TO AN ENHANCEMENT IN PROCESS UNDERSTANDING DUE TO THE CONTINUOUS PROCESSING AND EVALUATION OF PRODUCTION DATA. HENCE, WHEN PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED, IT EMPOWERS THE ABILITY TO INCREASE THE AGILITY, TRACEABILITY, AND RESILIENCE OF PRODUCTION SYSTEMS. DESPITE THESE MERITS, THE SCALABILITY AND FIDELITY OF DIGITALTWINS AT THE MANUFACTURING FIELD LEVEL ARE LIMITED BY HETEROGENEOUS DATA SOURCES AS WELL AS MODELING UNCERTAINTIES, E.G., DUE TO COARSE APPROXIMATION AND IMPRECISE PARAMETER IDENTIFICATION. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A NOVEL APPROACH TO OVERCOME THESE DEFICIENCIES BY EXPLOITING MACHINE LEARNING ON AGGREGATED DATA THROUGHOUT THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. A PROCEDURE IS ESTABLISHED TO CONTEXTUALIZE METADATA SOURCES FROM THE CONSTRUCTION, PLANNING, MANUFACTURING, AND QUALITY STAGES INTO A QUALITY FEATURE-BASED DIGITAL THREAD. ON THIS BASIS, A HYBRID APPROACH FOR QUANTIFYING MODELING UNCERTAINTIES ACROSS THE MODEL CHAIN IS DEVELOPED BY INCORPORATING THE PRODUCTION DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE INTO AI TECHNIQUES. AS A RESULT, THE DIGITALTWIN TAKES INTO ACCOUNT DISTURBANCES FROM THE PHYSICAL MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT AND ESTIMATES THE RELIABILITY OF THE MODELED OUTCOMES.

"THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IN GLOBAL MANUFACTURING HAS BEEN ATTRACTING MUCH ATTENTION DUE TO ITS ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR DRASTICALLY CHANGING THE COMPETITIVE DOMAIN OF VARIOUS INDUSTRIES IN RECENT YEARS. INDUSTRYFOURTH AFFIRMS THAT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IS A DRIVER OF TRANSFORMATION RELEVANT TO ALL INDUSTRIES AND MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS. WITHIN THIS CONCEPT, THE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) SIGNIFIES THAT ROBOTS, MATERIAL HANDLING EQUIPMENT SUCH AS AUTOMATED GUIDE VEHICLES, MACHINES, SENSORS, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT ARE NETWORKED AND ENABLED TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. WITH THE RAPID GROWTH OF INTEGRATING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND OPERATION TECHNOLOGIES IN INDUSTRY, SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO MAKE MANUFACTURING SMART. AS A CORE ELEMENT OF FUTURE MANUFACTURING, IOT-AIDED SIMULATION AND DIGITALTWIN TECHNOLOGY ARE GOING TO CHALLENGE AND CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONS. THEY ARE HELPFUL TOOLS TO PREPARE A LIVING MODEL THAT CONTINUOUSLY UPDATES AND CHANGES AS THE PHYSICAL COUNTERPART CHANGES TO REPRESENT STATUS, WORKING CONDITIONS, PRODUCT GEOMETRIES, AND RESOURCE STATES IN A SYNCHRONOUS MANNER. SUCH A DIGITAL REPRESENTATION PROVIDES BOTH THE ELEMENTS AND DYNAMICS OF HOW A PHYSICAL THING OPERATES AND LIVES THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE CYCLE.

THIS CONTEXT IMPLIES A MODIFICATION OF THE LAYOUT OF THE WORKSTATIONS DURING PRODUCTION, AND THUS REQUIRES A LIVE UPDATE OF THE DIGITALTWINS ACCORDING TO THESE MODIFICATIONS. WE NEEDED THIS UPDATE DONE BY THE OPERATORS DIRECTLY ON THE WORKSTATIONS USING AN AR AUTHORING TOOL. A LITERATURE REVIEW HELPED US TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA THAT A TOOL SHOULD FULFILL IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA ARE THAT THE TOOL SHOULD BE SUITABLE FOR USE BY OPERATORS NOT TRAINED IN AR, THAT THE LEARNING CURVE SHOULD BE SHORT, AND THAT IT SHOULD BE USABLE IN A RECONFIGURABLE FACTORY CONTEXT. WE CREATED A DT CONTAINING ALL THE NECESSARY FACTORY DATA AND 3D MODELS OF THE WORKSTATION INTERACTION ZONES OF A REAL ASSEMBLY LINE.

"THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION THAT HAS TOUCHED THE LAST DECADES, HAS INVOLVED SEVERAL SECTORS INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION WORLD. THE DIGITIZATION AND AUTOMATION OF INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES HAS IMPLEMENTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONNECTION PLATFORMS THAT CAN COMMUNICATE MANY INFORMATION FOR DIFFERENT USERS SUCH AS SMART GLASSES OR IMMERSIVE HEADSET. MOST OF THE TIME, INNOVATION DOES NOT ONLY CONCERN THE TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD, BUT INVOLVES THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATIONAL AND MANAGERIAL SPHERE. DIGITIZATION ALLOWS NEW TOOLS SUCH AS BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING TO EXPAND ITS APPLICATION SCALE, MAKING IT AN EXCELLENT TOOL FOR INTEGRATING AND SHARING DATA WITH THEIR OWN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (MES). THE AIMS OF THIS CONTRIBUTION ARE REPRODUCING A VIRTUAL WAREHOUSE THROUGH PARAMETRIC DIGITAL MODELLING, TO WHICH ALL THE MANAGEMENT DATA HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED; FOR EXAMPLE, THE AVERAGE STOCK, THE ROTATION INDEX, ETC.

"AN APPROACH TO BUILDING A MODEL OF A DIGITALTWIN OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IS PROPOSED. THE MODELING IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, HARMONIOUSLY COMBINING TWO INTERRELATED PROCESSES: SUSTAINABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT. DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES EXPANDING EXTERNAL RELATIONS, MARKETS, AND DEVELOPING SPECIALIZATION. HOWEVER, IN CASES OF CRISIS, INTERRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS, CLOSURE OF SALES MARKETS AND OTHER UNFAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES, THERE SHOULD ALWAYS REMAIN A PART OF THE ECONOMY, CLOSED ON ITSELF, USING ITS OWN RESOURCES AND WORKING FOR ITS CONSUMERS. THE PAPER CONSIDERS A STRUCTURAL AND MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION PROCESS, BASED ON THE SO-CALLED MODEL OF A TYPICAL PRODUCTION UNIT. IT IS A SYSTEM OF ALGEBRAIC EQUALITIES AND INEQUALITIES THAT ESTIMATE THE POWER OF INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE PROCESS AND ARE BASED ON BALANCE RATIOS. WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSED MODEL, IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMY OF INDIVIDUAL AGRICULTURAL REGIONS, EXPLORING BOTH COMPONENTS OF THE REGION'S ECONOMY AND ACHIEVING THEIR HARMONIOUS INTERACTION. THIS MODEL ALSO ALLOWS US TO CONSIDER THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF INDIVIDUAL SETTLEMENTS, RURAL SETTLEMENTS BASED ON LOCAL FARMS AND PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. IN EACH CASE, IT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE A HARMONIOUS COMBINATION OF STABILITY, SELF-SUFFICIENCY, AT LEAST FOOD INDEPENDENCE OF FARMS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT.

"OPTIMISING AN EXISTING PRODUCTION PLANT IS A CHALLENGING TASK FOR COMPANIES. NECESSARY PHYSICAL TEST RUNS DISTURB RUNNING PRODUCTION PROCESSES. SIMULATION MODELS ARE ONE OPPORTUNITY TO LIMIT THESE PHYSICAL TEST RUNS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT SINCE TODAY’S FAST AND INTELLIGENT NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES IN PRODUCTION SYSTEMS ARE IN LINE WITH THE CALL OF INDUSTRYFOURTH FOR SUBSTANTIAL AND FREQUENT CHANGES. CREATING SIMULATION MODELS FOR THOSE SYSTEMS REQUIRES HIGH EFFORT AND IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF PRODUCTION PROCESSES. IN THE CURRENT LITERATURE, DIGITALTWINS PROMISE SEVERAL ADVANTAGES FOR PRODUCTION OPTIMISATION AND CAN BE USED TO SIMULATE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, WHICH REDUCE NECESSARY PHYSICAL TEST RUNS AND RELATED COSTS. WHILE MOST COMPANIES ARE NOT ABLE TO CREATE DIGITALTWINS YET, COMPANIES USING ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP) SYSTEMS HAVE THE GENERAL CAPABILITY TO CREATE DIGITAL SHADOWS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A CONCEPT AND A CASE STUDY FOR A GENERIC SIMULATION OF PRODUCTION SYSTEMS IN ANYLOGIC™ TO CREATE DIGITAL SHADOWS AS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS A FULL DIGITALTWIN. THE GENERIC SIMULATION VISUALISES PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AUTOMATICALLY AND DISPLAYS KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIS) FOR THE PLANNED PRODUCTION PROGRAM, USING REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER (REST) INTERFACES TO EXTRACT PRODUCT AND PRODUCTION DATA FROM AN ERP SYSTEM.

FOR THIS PURPOSE, A TRANSIENT MODEL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN AVEVA DYNAMIC SIMULATION, BASED ON DATA FROM AN ARMFIELD UOP3CC DISTILLATION UNIT. A SUPERVISORY INTERFACE ALLOWED REAL-TIME MONITORING AND VARIABLE MANIPULATION. AN EXTERNAL CONTROLLER MODULE ENSURED THE PROPORTIONAL AND INTEGRAL ACTIONS FOR A LOOP THAT MANIPULATES THE REBOILER HEAT LOAD TO CONTROL STAGE TEMPERATURE. THE DISTILLATION UNIT IS EVALUATED WITH A WATER-ETHANOL MIXTURE AND THE MASS FRACTION WAS ESTIMATED, IN BATCH OPERATION AND DIFFERENT REFLUX CONFIGURATIONS. AT THE TOP, A SOLENOID VALVE GUARANTEES THE RETURN TO THE TOWER, AND THE CONCENTRATIONS ACHIEVED ARE CLOSE TO THE AZEOTROPIC POINT OF THE WATER-ETHANOL MIXTURE. THE DYNAMIC MODEL DEVELOPED WAS COMPARED TO EXPERIMENTAL DATA, AND A TIME-BASED VALIDATION WAS PERFORMED FROM STARTUP TO STEADY STATES OBTAINED FOR EACH PROFILE.

"FEATURED APPLICATION: THE CONCEPT OF A DIGITALTWIN IS EXTENDED TO THE SPECIFIC SCENE OF CONNECTING ROD PRODUCTION LINE PROCESSING. IT BEGAN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PRODUCT DESIGN STAGE, THROUGH THE VIRTUAL PROTOTYPE DESIGN OF PROCESSING EQUIPMENT, THE RAPID DESIGN OF THE WORKSHOP PRODUCTION LINE, AND THE PRELIMINARY PLANNING AND DEBUGGING. IT CAN NOT ONLY USE THE VIRTUAL MODEL OF A DIGITALTWIN TO VERIFY THE FEASIBILITY OF AN INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION LINE BUT ALSO OPTIMIZE THE PRODUCTION PLAN, FIND PROBLEMS IN ADVANCE, AND AVOID THEM IN TIME. IT CAN ALSO IMPROVE PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY, REDUCE THE PRODUCTION COST, AND IMPROVE PRODUCT QUALITY IN PROCESSING. IN PARTICULAR, IT HAS CERTAIN PRACTICAL GUIDANCE AND APPLICATION SIGNIFICANCE FOR PRE-TRAINING IN THE EARLY DESIGN STAGE OF ENTERPRISE PRODUCTION, REDUCING THE R&D CYCLE OF ENTERPRISES, AND IMPROVING THE SPEED OF PRODUCTION LINE DEBUGGING. THE GOAL OF ‘INDUSTRYFOURTH’ IS TO PROMOTE THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY TO INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING. BECAUSE OF ITS CHARACTERISTICS, THE DIGITALTWIN PERFECTLY MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING. IN THIS PAPER, THROUGH THE SIGNAL AND DATA OF THE S7-PLCSIM-ADVANCED CONNECTING TIA PORTAL AND NX MCD, THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND SIMULATION-BASED DEBUGGING OF MECHATRONICS IN AN AUTOMOBILE CONNECTING ROD PRODUCTION LINE BASED ON A DIGITALTWIN ARE REALIZED. THE MAIN CONTENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS: FIRSTLY, THE DATA ON THE AUTOMOBILE CONNECTING ROD PRODUCTION LINE ARE COLLECTED. THE DATA SOURCES IN THIS ARTICLE ARE MAINLY MCD VIRTUAL SENSORS, CAD MODELS, AND FACTORY PROCESSING HISTORY PRODUCTION DATA. SECONDLY, THE MODELING OF CONNECTING ROD PARTS AND THE PRODUCTION LINE IS CARRIED OUT. THE AUTOMOBILE CONNECTING ROD PRODUCTION LINE MODEL IS MAINLY DIVIDED INTO FIVE AREAS: PROCESSING AREA, ASSEMBLY AREA, CLEANING AREA, INSPECTION AREA, AND INVENTORY AREA. THIRDLY, FOR THE VALIDATION OF THE MODEL, THE SIMULATION SEQUENCE IS DESIGNED ACCORDING TO THE ACTUAL PROCESSING DATA OF THE FACTORY TO ENSURE THAT IT ACCURATELY REPRESENTS THE PRODUCTION LINE. FOURTHLY, CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN, MAINLY INCLUDING THE MAIN PROGRAM, RESET PROGRAM, SEQUENCE CONTROL SYSTEM FLOW PROGRAM, HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION, AND SO ON. FIFTHLY, SIMULATION AND DEBUGGING THROUGH THE DEBUGGING OF THE CONNECTING ROD IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSPORTATION IN THE PROCESS OF THE SUDDEN SLIPCASE ARE ANALYZED. SIXTHLY, MODEL DEPLOYMENT, THROUGH THE SPECIFIC ANALYSIS OF THE ACCUMULATION OF WORKPIECES TO BE PROCESSED BETWEEN PROCESS 10 AND PROCESS 11 TO DISCUSS THE OPTIMIZATION OF THE PRODUCTION LINE. SEVENTHLY, THE MODEL REFINEMENT, WHICH EXPLAINS THE LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH CONTENT AND DISCUSSES FUTURE WORK. FINALLY, BY COMPARING THE TRADITIONAL PRODUCT DEBUGGING MODE WITH THE VIRTUAL SIMULATION DEBUGGING MODE OF THE AUTOMOBILE CONNECTING ROD PRODUCTION LINE BASED ON DIGITALTWIN, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE VIRTUAL SIMULATION DEBUGGING OF THE AUTOMOBILE CONNECTING ROD PRODUCTION LINE BASED ON DIGITALTWIN WILL GREATLY REDUCE THE ACTUAL DEBUGGING TIME OF THE PRODUCTION LINE, THUS SPEEDING UP THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS AND IMPROVING THE INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS. © 2023 BY THE AUTHORS.",DESIGN AND SIMULATION DEBUGGING OF AUTOMOBILE CONNECTING ROD PRODUCTION LINE BASED ON THE DIGITALTWIN
"HISTORICALLY, RESEARCHERS AND MANAGERS HAVE OFTEN FAILED TO CONSIDER ORGANIZATIONS AS A SUM OF FUNCTIONS LEADING TO A SET OF CAPABILITIES THAT PRODUCE A PRODUCT THAT CAN SERVE SOCIETY’S NEEDS. FURTHERMORE, FUNCTIONS HAVE INCREASED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONS, HOWEVER, MANY MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATIONS HAVE NOT REALIZED THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. AS A RESULT, MANY INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT KNOW WHY, WHERE, AND WHEN THE EXISTING FUNCTIONS AND PROJECTS FOR IMPLEMENTING NEW FUNCTIONS FAIL WHERE TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC FUNCTIONS OF A MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATION ARE COMMONLY OVER-SEEN. THUS, THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO PROPOSE A HOLISTIC APPROACH FOR MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATIONS IN ORDER TO MODEL THEIR FUNCTIONS ENABLING THE ASSESSMENT, DESIGN, MANAGEMENT, AND CONTROL OF OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS TO IDENTIFY IMPROVEMENT POTENTIALS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A CONCEPTUAL MODEL WAS DEVELOPED BASED ON THE EVOLUTION OF FUNCTIONS ALONG WITH THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONS. MOREOVER, USING THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL, MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE MODELED, CONSIDERING COMMON ORGANIZATIONAL FUNCTIONS IN THE RESPECTIVE AREAS OF PRODUCTION, MAINTENANCE, AND QUALITY, ETC., IN THE THREE PLANNING HORIZONS—STRATEGIC, TACTICAL, AND OPERATIVE. AS A RESULT, THE MODEL SERVES AS A BASIS FOR THE INTEGRAL MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATIONS. MOREOVER, IT CAN BE ALSO USED AS A BASIS FRAMEWORK FOR A DIGITALTWIN MODEL FOR ORGANIZATIONS. THUS, A SYSTEM DYNAMICS SIMULATION MODEL BASED ON THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL WAS DEVELOPED FOR A GENERIC ORGANIZATION.

"INDUSTRYFOURTH IS BASED ON THE DIGITIZATION OF MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES AND HAS RAISED THE PROSPECT FOR SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCTIVITY, QUALITY, AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. THIS DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION NOT ONLY AFFECTS THE WAY PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BUT ALSO CREATES NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DESIGN OF PRODUCTS, PROCESSES, SERVICES, AND SYSTEMS. UNLIKE TRADITIONAL DESIGN PRACTICES BASED ON SYSTEM-CENTRIC CONCEPTS, DESIGN FOR THESE NEW OPPORTUNITIES REQUIRES A HOLISTIC VIEW OF THE HUMAN (STAKEHOLDER), ARTEFACT (PRODUCT), AND PROCESS (REALIZATION) DIMENSIONS OF THE DESIGN PROBLEM. IN THIS PAPER WE ENVISION A “HUMAN-CYBER-PHYSICAL VIEW OF THE SYSTEMS REALIZATION ECOSYSTEM,” TERMED “DESIGN ENGINEERING 4.0 (DE4.0),” TO RECONCEPTUALIZE HOW CYBER AND PHYSICAL TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATED TO IDENTIFY AND FULFIL CUSTOMER NEEDS AND GARNER THE BENEFITS OF INDUSTRYFOURTH.

"THE ADVENT OF INDUSTRYFOURTH HAS RESULTED IN A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE ROLE OF ASSEMBLY LINES IN A MANUFACTURING SYSTEM. PREVIOUSLY, ASSEMBLY LINES WERE THE CENTRAL COMPONENT IN BRINGING ABOUT MASS PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, THE SHIFT IN FOCUS FROM MASS PRODUCTION TO MASS CUSTOMIZATION HAS RESULTED IN SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE TRADITIONAL ASSEMBLY LINE. A NOTABLE CHANGE IS THE NEED TO CREATE A DIGITALTWIN, WHICH CAN REPLICATE PHYSICAL ASSETS, PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS THAT FULFILL THE VARIOUS PROCESSES IN A REAL WORLD PLANT. THIS PAPER LOOKS AT CREATING A DIGITALTWIN FOR THE OPTIMIZATION OF A WATER BOTTLING PLANT IN A PRODUCTION LINE. THE DIGITALTWIN UTILIZES AN OPEN PLATFORM COMMUNICATION SERVER TO COLLECT SENSOR INFORMATION FROM THE PRODUCTION LINE THROUGH A PLC. ONCE THE DIGITALTWIN HAS PROCESSED THE INFORMATION, THE APPLIED SOLUTION CAN THEN BE SENT BACK TO THE OPEN PLATFORM COMMUNICATION SERVER AND READ IN BY THE INDIVIDUAL PLC'S TO REDUCE BOTTLENECKS AND PRODUCTION DELAYS. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY SETTING UP A DIGITALTWIN WITH THREE SMARTMANUFACTURING UNITS THAT ARE TASKED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF 500ML WATER BOTTLES. HERE PREMADE 500ML BOTTLES ARE FED INTO THE SYSTEM, FILLED BY THE FIRST SMARTMANUFACTURING UNIT, CAPPED BY THE SECOND AND THIRDLY PACKAGED TO ORDER.

"ONE OBJECTIVE OF INDUSTRYFOURTH IS TO REACH A BETTER SYSTEM PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS TO HAVE A BETTER CONSIDERATION OF HUMANS. THIS WOULD BE DONE BY BENEFITING FROM KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF HUMANS, AND BALANCING IN A REACTIVE WAY SOME COMPLEX OR COMPLICATED TASKS WITH INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS. SEVERAL STUDIES ALREADY DEALT WITH SUCH AN OBJECTIVE, BUT FEW ARE DONE AT A METHODOLOGICAL LEVEL, WHICH FORBIDS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CORRECT EVALUATION OF DESIGN CHOICES IN TERMS OF HUMAN AWARENESS OF THE SITUATION OR MENTAL WORKLOAD WHEN DESIGNING INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS INTEGRATING THE HUMAN. INDEED, INCREASING THE INTELLIGENCE AND AUTONOMY OF INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS AND THEIR COMPOSING ENTITIES (RESOURCES, PRODUCTS, ROBOTS…), AS FOSTERED BY INDUSTRYFOURTH, INCREASES THEIR OVERALL COMPLEXITY. THIS MODIFICATION REDUCES THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE BEHAVIORS OF THESE SYSTEMS, AND LEADS TO THE DIFFICULTY FOR HUMANS NOT ONLY TO ELABORATE ALTERNATIVE DECISIONS WHEN REQUIRED, BUT ALSO TO MAKE EFFECTIVE DECISIONS AND UNDERSTAND THEIR CONSEQUENCES. THIS PAPER EVALUATES SUCH A DESIGN METHODOLOGY, THE COGNITIVE WORK ANALYSIS (CWA), AND ITS APPLICABILITY WHEN DESIGNING AN ASSISTANCE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT HUMAN IN THE CONTROL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING SYSTEM IN INDUSTRYFOURTH. AMONG SEVERAL FUNCTIONS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF CWA, THE ASSISTANT SYSTEM MIGHT HAVE TO INTEGRATE A DIGITALTWIN OF THE INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING SYSTEM. THE EVALUATION OF THE METHODOLOGY THROUGH THE ONE OF THE DESIGNED ASSISTANT SYSTEMS IS DONE USING A MICRO-WORLD, WHICH IS AN INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING CELL COMPOSED OF INTELLIGENT MOBILE GROUND ROBOTS, PRODUCTS, AND STATIC PRODUCTION ROBOTS INTERACTING TOGETHER AND WITH A HUMAN SUPERVISOR IN CHARGE OF THE REACHING OF SEVERAL TIME-BASED AND ENERGY-BASED PERFORMANCES INDICATORS.

NOWADAYS, THIS QUEST HAS ACHIEVED A NEW DIMENSION DUE TO THE HIGH MARKET COMPETITIVENESS. MOREOVER, IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO NOTICE AN IMPROVEMENT OF THE QUALITY STANDARDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES. BOTH QUESTS HAVE INCREASED DEMAND FOR NEW PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND SUSTAINABLE THAN THE TECHNOLOGIES THEY REPLACE. LEADING TO A CONTINUOUS NEED TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES, IMPROVE EXISTING SOLUTIONS OR EVEN MERGE EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES INTO A SINGLE PROCESS TO REDUCE INTERMEDIATE STAGES DURING PRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, REDUCING THE PRODUCTION TIME OF THE PRODUCTS. IN RECENT YEARS, ONE OF THE PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAS SEEN A GREAT INCREASE IN POPULARITY, AND THEREFORE IN NEW DEVELOPMENTS ARE THE ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING (AM) PROCESSES. THIS INCREASE IN POPULARITY IS DUE TO SOME MAJOR ASPECTS, IN FIRST PLACE IS THE FACT THAT AM GENERATES LESS RAW MATERIAL WASTE DURING PRODUCTION THAT TRADITIONAL SOLUTIONS, IN SOME CASES THE RAW MATERIAL WASTE IS ALMOST ZERO. IN THE OTHER HAND IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR A GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND CONTINUOUS CHANGE OF THE PRODUCTION DESIGN SINCE IT DOES REQUIRE FEWER, OR EVEN NO TOOLS, TO ASSIST THE PRODUCTION, ESPECIALLY AM BASED ON POWDER BED FUSION (PBF).

FIRST AND FOREMOST, THE STRUCTURAL BEHAVIOUR OF THE SHEET METAL IS INVESTIGATED USING THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD FOR THE NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF THE THREE-POINT BEND-ING PROCESS. THE ANALYSIS' FINDINGS ENABLED THE PREDICTION OF COMPONENT REAC-TION TO LOADS, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE FURTHER OPTIMIZATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE TOOLING SYSTEM'S FLEXIBILITY. AT THE INITIAL STAGE OF THE DEVELOPMENT PHASE, SOLIDWORKS, THE COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN SOFTWARE, IS UTILIZED TO VISUALISE THE FLEXIBLE TOOLING SYSTEM AND IMPROVE THE TOOLING CONNECTIVITY DESIGN. FURTHER-MORE, THE PROTOTYPE IS DEVELOPED BY INTEGRATING MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL COM-PONENTS, SUCH AS THE ARDUINO MEGA MICROCONTROLLER, STEPPER MOTORS, AND DIGITAL STEPPER DRIVERS. AUTOMATION IS ACHIEVED BY PROGRAMMING THE ARDUINO MICRO-CONTROLLER BOARD AND CONTROLLING THE STEPPER MOTORS' MOVEMENT TO ENSURE PRE-CISE DISPLACEMENT AND SPEED CONTROL OF THE FORMING TOOLS. THE TOOLING SYSTEM'S MAJOR QUALITIES ARE ITS HIGH FLEXIBILITY, ACHIEVED THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TWO MOVEABLE SUPPORT CYLINDERS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING FURTHER UPGRADED TO A CLOSED-LOOP FORMING SYSTEM.

"GOAL: THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF INSERTING A COLLABORATIVE ROBOT IN A PRODUCTION LINE OF A FACTORY OF THE AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR. DESIGN / METHODOLOGY / APPROACH: TWO SIMULATION ENVIRONMENTS WERE DEVELOPED. THE FIRST ONE MODELS THE ORIGINAL OPERATION WITHOUT THE COLLABORATIVE ROBOT. THE SECOND ONE EVALUATES THE IMPACT OF INSERTING THE ROBOT. THIS WORK IS QUANTITATIVE. RESULTS: THE PAPER PRESENTS THE USE OF DIGITAL MANUFACTURING TOOLS IN A SIMULATION OF A COLLABORATIVE OPERATION BETWEEN A HUMAN AND A COLLABORATIVE ROBOT. THE SIMULATIONS WITH AND WITHOUT THE COLLABORATIVE ROBOT WERE PERFORMED, AND THEY MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO EMPHA-SIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE COLLABORATIVE OPERATION IN A REAL PRODUCTION LINE. LIMITATIONS OF THE INVESTIGATION: THE FIRST SIMULATION SCENARIO WAS VALIDATED FROM THE REAL DATA PROVIDED BY THE FACTORY. HOWEVER, THE SECOND SCENARIO IS A SUGGESTION, EMPHASIZING THE BENEFITS OF COLLABORATIVE OPERATION. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SECOND SCENARIO WAS NOT CONDUCTED. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: SINCE ITS COMPLETION DEPENDED ON SUPPORT FROM THE AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR, THIS WORK IS NOTICEABLY PRACTICAL. THE REAL DATA USED IN THE FIRST SCENARIO AS WELL AS THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN THE SECOND SCENARIO ALLOW ONE TO CONCLUDE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSITIONS WITH THE COLLABORATIVE ROBOT IN THE CHOSEN LINE. ORIGINALITY / VALUE: THE USE OF THE COLLABORATIVE ROBOT IN BRAZIL WAS FORBIDDEN BY REGULA-TION UNTIL RECENTLY. EVEN IN OTHER COUNTRIES DECISION MAKERS STILL FIND HAVE DIFFICULTY DECID-ING FOR THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY. FOR THIS REASON, THE BENEFITS OF USING COLLABORATIVE ROBOTS, MAINLY IN BRAZILIAN COMPANIES, IS STILL NOT CLEAR.

"INDUSTRYFOURTH IS REVOLUTIONIZING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION BY BRIDGING THE PHYSICAL AND THE VIRTUAL WORLDS AND FURTHER IMPROVING DIGITALIZATION. TWO ESSENTIAL BUILDING BLOCKS IN INDUSTRYFOURTH ARE DIGITALTWINS (DT) AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT). WHILE IOT IS ABOUT CONNECTING RESOURCES AND COLLECTING DATA ABOUT THE PHYSICAL WORLD, DTS ARE THE VIRTUAL REPRESENTATIONS OF RESOURCES ORGANIZING AND MANAGING INFORMATION AND BEING TIGHTLY INTEGRATED WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, MACHINE LEARNING AND COGNITIVE SERVICES TO FURTHER OPTIMIZE AND AUTOMATE PRODUCTION. THE CONCEPTS OF DTS AND IOT ARE OVERLAPPING WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING, DISCOVERING AND ACCESSING RESOURCES. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE MULTIPLE DT AND IOT STANDARDS COVERING THESE OVERLAPPING ASPECTS CREATED BY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS WITH DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND PERSPECTIVES. WITH REGARD TO INTEROPERABILITY, WHICH IS PRESUMABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF INDUSTRYFOURTH, THIS BARRIER NEEDS TO BE OVERCOME BY CONSOLIDATION OF STANDARDS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE CURRENT DT AND IOT STANDARDS AND PROVIDE INSIGHTS TO STIMULATE THIS CONSOLIDATION. OVERLAPPING ASPECTS ARE IDENTIFIED AND A CLASSIFICATION SCHEME IS CREATED AND APPLIED TO THE STANDARDS.

ARE BEING EXECUTED IN THOSE VIRTUAL SIMULATIONS. MOREOVER, NEW WAYS OF INTERACTIONS AND INTERFACE TO OVERSEE, INTERACT AND LEARN ARE BEING DEVELOPED VIA THE ASSISTANCE OF VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) AND AUGMENTED REALITY (AR) TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH ARE ALREADY WIDELY SPREAD ON THE CONSUMER MARKET. HOWEVER, ALREADY, VR IS BEING USED WIDELY IN EXISTING COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE PACKAGES AND TOOLBOXES TO PROVIDE STUDENTS, TEACHERS, OPERATORS, ENGINEERS, PRODUCTION MANAGERS, AND RESEARCHERS WITH AN IMMERSIVE WAY OF INTERACTING WITH THE FACTORY WHILE THE MANUFACTURING SIMULATION IS RUNNING. THIS GIVES A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND MORE IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THE ACTUAL MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, NOT BEING DIRECTLY ACCESSING THOSE. HOWEVER, THE VIRTUAL PRESENCE MENTIONED ABOVE EXPERIENCE IS LIMITED TO A SINGLE PERSON. IT DOES NOT ENABLE ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITIES FOR THE SIMULATIONS, WHICH CAN BE RE-PLANNING OR EVEN RE-PROGRAMMING OF THE PHYSICAL FACTORY IN AN ONLINE CONNECTION BY USING VR OR AR INTERFACES.

APPLICATION OF DT INCLUDES REAL-TIME MONITORING, DESIGNING/PLANNING, OPTIMIZATION, MAINTENANCE, REMOTE ACCESS, ETC. ITS IMPLEMENTATION IS EXPECTED TO GROW EXPONENTIALLY IN THE COMING DECADES. THE ADVENT OF INDUSTRYFOURTH HAS BROUGHT COMPLEX INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE MORE AUTONOMOUS, SMART, AND HIGHLY INTERCONNECTED. THESE SYSTEMS GENERATE CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS OF DATA USEFUL FOR SEVERAL APPLICATIONS SUCH AS IMPROVING PERFORMANCE, PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE, TRAINING, ETC. A SUDDEN INFLUX IN THE NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS RELATED TO ‘DIGITALTWIN’ HAS LED TO CONFUSION BETWEEN DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGIES RELATED TO THE DIGITALIZATION OF INDUSTRIES. ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT HAS ARISEN DUE TO THE GROWING POPULARITY OF DT IS A LACK OF CONSENSUS ON THE DESCRIPTION OF DT AS WELL AS SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF DT, WHICH ADDS TO THE CONFUSION. THIS PAPER INTENDS TO CONSOLIDATE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DT AND DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF DT THROUGHOUT THE LITERATURE FOR EASY IDENTIFICATION OF DT FROM THE REST OF THE COMPLIMENTARY TERMS SUCH AS ‘PRODUCT AVATAR’, ‘DIGITAL THREAD’, ‘DIGITAL MODEL’, AND ‘DIGITAL SHADOW’.

"SMARTMANUFACTURING (SM) SYSTEMS UTILIZE RUN-TIME DATA TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY VIA INTELLIGENT DECISION-MAKING AND ANALYSIS MECHANISMS ON BOTH MACHINE AND SYSTEM LEVELS. THE INCREASED ADOPTION OF CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS IN SM LEADS TO THE COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK OF CYBER-PHYSICAL MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS (CPMS) WHERE DATA-ENABLED DECISION-MAKING MECHANISMS ARE COUPLED WITH CYBER-PHYSICAL RESOURCES ON THE PLANT FLOOR. DUE TO THEIR CYBER-PHYSICAL NATURE, CPMS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CYBER-ATTACKS THAT MAY CAUSE HARM TO THE MANUFACTURING SYSTEM, PRODUCTS, OR EVEN THE HUMAN WORKERS INVOLVED IN THIS CONTEXT. THEREFORE, DETECTING CYBER-ATTACKS EFFICIENTLY AND TIMELY IS A CRUCIAL STEP TOWARD IMPLEMENTING AND SECURING HIGH-PERFORMANCE CPMS IN PRACTICE. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES TWO KEY CHALLENGES TO CPMS CYBER-ATTACK DETECTION. THE FIRST CHALLENGE IS DISTINGUISHING EXPECTED ANOMALIES IN THE SYSTEM FROM CYBER-ATTACKS.

"BESIDE ALL THE CHALLENGES REGARDING CLIMATE CHANGE, RESOURCES SCARCITY AND QUALITY DEGRADATION OF DEPOSITS, THE MINING INDUSTRY IS BECOMING AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS CONSTANTLY UNDER PRESSURE AND RESTRICTIVE. THE INCREASING OF RAW MATERIALS PRICES, THE UNSTABLE AND HIGH VOLATILE COMMODITY PRICES, THE DECREASING ORE GRADES AND THE RISING ENERGY COST HAVE SHOWN A CLINICAL IMPACT ON THE MINING SECTOR. ONE WAY TO MITIGATE THE VARIABILITY CAUSED BY THESE EXTERNAL FORCES IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LATEST ADVANCED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND SET UP AN INNOVATIVE STRATEGY TO OPTIMISE THE PROCESSING COST. A KEY ENABLER FOR THE OPTIMISATION OF THE MINERAL PROCESSING VALUE CHAIN AND FOR THE DIGITAL DISRUPTION OF THE MINING SECTOR IS THE DIGITALTWIN. DIGITALTWIN ENCOMPASSES DIGITAL MODELS OF THE PRODUCTION MODELS ENABLING A VIRTUAL REPRESENTATION OF A PHYSICAL SYSTEM AND ENSURING A CONTINUOUS REAL TIME INTERACTION, CORRECTION, CONTROL AND OPTIMISATION. CONSEQUENTLY, THE DIGITALTWIN COULD AFFORD AN ALLEVIATION OF THE MINERAL PROCESSING VARIABILITY IN TERMS OF MINERALOGY, FINAL PRODUCT’S GRADES, MECHANICAL SETTING AND PROCESSING CONFIGURATION. THIS TOPIC IS A PART OF THE MOROCCAN NATIONAL PROJECT “SMART CONNECTED MINE” THAT AROSE AFTER THE CONSORTIUM OF INDUSTRIALS AND RESEARCHERS FOR THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE MINING INDUSTRY. IN THIS PAPER, THE BACKGROUND OF THE DIGITALTWIN, ITS TYPES AND THE MAJOR MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT IT ARE PRESENTED.

"THE OPERABILITY APPROACH HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLY APPLIED TO MEASURE THE ABILITY OF A CONTINUOUS PROCESS TO ACHIEVE DESIRED SPECIFICATIONS, GIVEN PHYSICAL OR DESIGN RESTRICTIONS AND CONSIDERING EXPECTED DISTURBANCES AT STEADY STATE. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES A NOVEL DYNAMIC OPERABILITY ANALYSIS FOR BATCH PROCESSES BASED ON CLASSICAL OPERABILITY CONCEPTS. IN THIS ANALYSIS, ALL SETS AND STATISTICAL REGION DELIMITATIONS ARE QUANTIFIED USING MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS INVOLVING POLYTOPES AT EVERY TIME STEP. A STATISTICAL OPERABILITY ANALYSIS CENTERED ON MULTIVARIATE CORRELATIONS IS EMPLOYED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO EVALUATE DESIRED OUTPUT SETS DURING TRANSITION THAT SERVE AS REFERENCES TO BE FOLLOWED TO ACHIEVE THE FINAL PROCESS SPECIFICATIONS. A DYNAMIC DESIGN SPACE FOR A BATCH PROCESS IS, THUS, GENERATED THROUGH THIS ANALYSIS PROCESS AND CAN BE USED IN PRACTICE TO GUIDE PROCESS OPERATION. A PROBABILISTIC EXPECTED DISTURBANCE SET IS ALSO INTRODUCED, WHEREBY THE DISTURBANCES ARE DESCRIBED BY PSEUDORANDOM VARIABLES AND DISTURBANCE SCENARIOS OTHER THAN WORST-CASE SCENARIOS ARE CONSIDERED, AS IS DONE IN TRADITIONAL OPERABILITY METHODS. A CASE STUDY CORRESPONDING TO A PILOT BATCH UNIT IS USED TO ILLUSTRATE THE DEVELOPED METHODS AND TO BUILD A PROCESS DIGITALTWIN TO GENERATE LARGE DATASETS BY RUNNING AN AUTOMATED DIGITAL EXPERIMENTATION STRATEGY.

"IN ORDER TO ENABLE CHANGEABLE PRODUCTION OF INDUSTRYFOURTH APPLICATIONS, A PRODUCTION SYSTEM SHOULD RESPOND TO UNPREDICTABLE CHANGES QUICKLY AND ADEQUATELY. THIS REQUIRES PROCESS PLANNING TO BE PERFORMED BASED ON THE REAL TIME OPERATING CONDITIONS AND DYNAMIC CHANGES TO BE HANDLED WITH COGNITIVE SKILLS. TO MEET THIS DEMAND, WE PRESENT A PROCESS PLANNING APPROACH USING DIGITALTWINS AND REINFORCEMENT LEARNING TO DERIVE NEAR-OPTIMAL PROCESS PLANS. THE DIGITALTWINS ENABLE ACCESS TO REAL-TIME INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM. THEY ALSO CONSTITUTE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAINING THE AGENT OF THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING METHOD. THE ENVIRONMENT WORKS AS A VIRTUAL PLANT, CONTAINING THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE PRODUCT AND RESOURCES, AND USES SIMULATION MODELS OF THE RESOURCES TO CALCULATE THE REWARD FOR AN ACTION IN TERMS OF REINFORCEMENT LEARNING. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ENABLES OUR APPROACH TO DERIVE PROCESS PLANS VIA TRIAL AND ERROR. BESIDES THE VIRTUAL PLANT, OUR APPROACH HAS A PLANNER, WHICH PLAYS THE ROLE OF THE AGENT TO DERIVE NEAR-OPTIMAL PLANS BY TRYING DIFFERENT ACTIONS IN THE VIRTUAL PLANT, AND OBSERVES THE REWARDS. WE APPLY THE Q-LEARNING ALGORITHM TO DERIVE NEAR OPTIMAL PROCESS PLANS. THE EVALUATION RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR APPROACH IS ABLE TO DERIVE NEAR-OPTIMAL PROCESS PLANS FOR DIFFERENT PROBLEM SIZES. THE EVALUATION ALSO DEMONSTRATED THE PLANNER'S ABILITY TO IDENTIFY BY ITSELF WHICH ACTION TO TAKE IN WHICH SITUATION.

"DIGITALTWINS (DT) AND THEIR APPLICATIONS IN PROGNOSTICS AND DIAGNOSTICS HAVE BEEN RAPIDLY GROWING AND BECOMING HIGHLY VALUABLE FOR VARIOUS INDUSTRIES. THEY POSSESS THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE (RUL) OF A DEVICE AND AVOID COSTLY MAINTENANCE OR FAILURE. DIGITALTWINS CAN BE DEFINED AS A REAL-TIME BIDIRECTIONAL DATA EXCHANGE OF A PHYSICAL ENTITY AND ITS CYBER MANIFESTATION. THIS TECHNOLOGY RELIES ON SOPHISTICATED DEVELOPMENT AND EFFECTIVE SENSOR PLACEMENT TO EXCEL IN SMART MAINTENANCE RELATED FIELDS. HOWEVER, TOO MANY SENSORS CAN JEOPARDIZE THE ABILITY OF THE DIGITALTWIN TO PERFORM EFFECTIVELY. A SURPLUS OF SENSORS CORRESPONDS WITH LARGE DATA SETS WHICH INCREASE THE COMPUTATIONAL EXPENSE. LIVE DIGITALTWIN IS A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL-BASED SOLUTION TO DEVELOP DIGITALTWINS FOR ASSET MANAGEMENT ENABLED THROUGH SENSOR COMMUNICATION. THE LIVE STRUCTURE IS COMPOSED OF FOUR PRINCIPLE PHASES, LEARN, IDENTIFY, VERIFY, AND EXTEND, WITH THE PURPOSE OF DESIGNING AND OPTIMIZING THE DIGITALTWIN USING MULTI-PHYSICS SIMULATIONS. THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO PRESENT THE LIVE ARCHITECTURE TO PRESCRIBE EFFECTIVE SENSOR LOCATIONS FOR DIGITALTWINS. FURTHERMORE, WITHOUT LOSS OF GENERALITY, THE LEARN AND IDENTIFY PHASES ARE APPLIED IN A CASE STUDY TO DEVELOP A MAINTENANCE SOLUTION FOR A LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT SYSTEM. TO ACHIEVE THIS, VARIOUS DYNAMIC SIMULATION DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM A HIGH-FIDELITY MODEL TO CALIBRATE THE PERFORMANCE OF A LOW FIDELITY MODEL. THE ADVANTAGEOUS COMPUTATIONAL SPEED OF LOW FIDELITY MODELS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO QUICKLY ANALYZE VARIOUS FAULTY CONDITIONS FOR THE SYSTEM. AS THE SYSTEM DEGRADES, THE NATURAL FREQUENCIES OF THE VIBRATION DEVIATE THUS LEADING TO POTENTIAL RESONANCE AND SYSTEM FAILURE.

BY VIRTUALIZING AND TWINNING INFORMATION STEMMING FROM THE REAL AND THE DIGITAL WORLD, IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO CONNECT ALL PARTS OF THE PRODUCTION PROCESS BY HAVING VIRTUAL COPIES OF PHYSICAL ELEMENTS INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER IN THE DIGITAL AND PHYSICAL REALMS. HOWEVER, THIS ALONE DOES NOT IMPLY COGNITION. COGNITION REQUIRES MODELLING NOT ONLY THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS BUT ALSO THE BEHAVIOR OF PRODUCTION ELEMENTS AND PROCESSES. THE LATTER CAN BE FOUNDED UPON DATA-DRIVEN MODELS PRODUCED VIA DATA ANALYTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES, GIVING RISE TO THE SO-CALLED COGNITIVE (DIGITAL) TWIN. TO FURTHER ENABLE THE COGNITIVE FACTORY, A NOVEL CONCEPT, DUBBED AS ENHANCED COGNITIVE TWIN (ECT), IS PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER AS A WAY TO INTRODUCE ADVANCED COGNITIVE CAPABILITIES TO THE DT ARTEFACT THAT ENABLE SUPPORTING DECISIONS, WITH THE END GOAL TO ENABLE DTS TO REACT TO INNER OR OUTER STIMULI. THE ENHANCED COGNITIVE TWIN CAN BE DEPLOYED AT DIFFERENT HIERARCHICAL LEVELS OF THE PRODUCTION PROCESS, I.E., AT SENSOR-, MACHINE-, PROCESS-, EMPLOYEE- OR EVEN FACTORY-LEVEL, AGGREGATED TO ALLOW BOTH HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL INTERPLAY.

PARTICULARLY, THE CONCEPT OF DIGITALTWINS HAS BEEN INTRODUCED TO CREATE THE VIRTUAL REPRESENTATION OF PHYSICAL SYSTEMS WHERE BOTH ELEMENTS ARE CONNECTED TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION. THIS GENERAL DEFINITION ENCOMPASSES A SERIES OF MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR THE DEVELOPERS OF THOSE FUNCTIONALITIES. AMONG THEM IS HOW TO INTRODUCE THE HUMAN PERSPECTIVE INTO THE VIRTUAL REPLICA. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN APPROACH FOR INCORPORATING HUMAN FACTORS IN DIGITALTWINS.

"IN THE CONTEXT OF SMART FACTORIES, WHERE INTELLIGENT MACHINES SHARE DATA AND SUPPORT ENHANCED FUNCTIONALITIES AT A FACTORY LEVEL, WORKERS ARE STILL SEEN AS SPECTATORS RATHER THAN ACTIVE PLAYERS (HERMANN, PENTEK, & OTTO, 2017). INSTEAD, INDUSTRYFOURTH REPRESENTS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR WORKERS TO BECOME PART OF THE INTELLIGENT SYSTEM; ON ONE HAND, OPERATORS CAN GENERATE DATA TO PROGRAM MACHINES AND OPTIMIZE THE PROCESS FLOWS, ON THE OTHER HAND THEY CAN RECEIVE USEFUL INFORMATION TO SUPPORT THEIR WORK AND COOPERATE WITH SMART SYSTEMS (ROMERO ET AL., 2016). DIVERSELY FROM MACHINES, HUMANS ARE NATURALLY SMART, FLEXIBLE AND INTELLIGENT, SO PUTTING THE OPERATORS IN THE DIGITAL LOOP CAN BRING MORE POWERFUL AND EFFICIENT FACTORIES. THE PAPER AIMS AT DEFINING A THEORETICAL HUMAN-CENTERED FRAMEWORK FOR OPERATOR 4.0, AND TESTING ITS FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT ON COMPANIES, THANKS TO THE INTEGRATION OF HUMAN FACTORS IN 4.0 COMPUTERIZED INDUSTRIAL CONTEXTS. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK IS BASED ON DATA COLLECTION ABOUT THE WORKERS’ PERFORMANCE, ACTIONS AND REACTIONS, WITH THE FINAL OBJECTIVE TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL FACTORY PERFORMANCE AND ORGANIZATION. DATA ARE USED TO ASSESS THE WORKERS’ ERGONOMICS PERFORMANCE AND PERCEIVED COMFORT AND TO BUILD A PROPER KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE HUMAN ASSET OF THE FACTORY, TO BE INTEGRATED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE DERIVED FROM MACHINE DATA COLLECTION. THE FRAMEWORK IS CASED ON THE ADOPTION OF AN OPERATOR 4.0 MONITORING SYSTEM, WHICH CONSISTS OF AN EYE TRACKING AND A WEARABLE BIOSENSOR, COMBINED TO A PROPER PROTOCOL ANALYSIS TO INTERPRET DATA AND CREATE A SOLID KNOWLEDGE. VIRTUAL PROTOTYPES ARE USED TO MAKE THE WORKERS INTERACT WITH THE DIGITAL FACTORY TO CONVENIENTLY SIMULATE THE HUMAN–MACHINE INTERACTION (HMI) IN ORDER TO AVOID BOTTLENECKS AT THE SHOP FLOOR, TO OPTIMIZE THE WORKFLOWS, AND TO IMPROVE THE WORKSTATIONS’ DESIGN AND LAYOUT.

IN CASE OF SCALING UP OR DOWN THE PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO SATISFY UNPREDICTABLE MARKET DEMANDS OR TO RESPOND FLEXIBLY TO DISRUPTIONS AND FAILURES. HOWEVER, TO REACH THE NEXT GENERATION OF CPPS OR SMART FACTORIES, THE CONCURRENT COMBINATION OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD WITH ITS DIGITAL COUNTERPART WILL BE CRUCIAL. GIVEN THE FACT THAT PRODUCTS ARE BECOMING EVEN MORE COMPLEX AND THAT THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE DECREASES, THE USAGE OF SIMULATION TOOLS GROW IN IMPORTANCE FOR THE OPTIMIZATION AND ACCELERATION OF ALL PHASES OF THE PRODUCTION LIFE-CYCLE. SIMULATION TOOLS ARE INTENDED TO SUPPORT (RE-)ENGINEERING AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES, TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL CHANGES AND TO REACT IN A TIMELY MANNER TO CRITICAL INFLUENCES ON PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT. THIS PAPER DEALS WITH UPCOMING CHALLENGES TO EXPLOIT THE FULL POTENTIAL OF MODELING AND SIMULATION WITHIN SMART FACTORIES. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, AN APPROPRIATE FRAMEWORK FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION OF CPS-BASED FACTORIES IS PRESENTED.

"THE AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF DIGITALTWINS OF INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES REQUIRES THE INTEGRATION OF SEVERAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION. IF THE TWIN IS EXPECTED TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE THERMO-HYDRAULIC PHENOMENA, DIMENSIONS OF TANKS AND OTHER PROCESS COMPONENTS AS WELL AS DETAILED PIPE ROUTING INFORMATION IS RELEVANT. SUCH INFORMATION IS NOT COMPREHENSIVELY CAPTURED IN PIDS (PIPING INSTRUMENTATION DIAGRAMS), BUT IT IS AVAILABLE FROM 3D CAD MODELS. HOWEVER, INFORMATION ABOUT CONTROL LOOPS IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM 3D CAD MODELS, BUT IS AVAILABLE FROM PIDS. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THE EXTRACTION OF SUCH INFORMATION FROM MACHINE-READABLE PIDS AND 3D CAD MODELS AND CONVERTING THIS INFORMATION TO GRAPHS. FURTHER RESEARCH IS EXPECTED ON APPLYING GRAPH MATCHING METHODS FOR INTEGRATING THESE SEPARATE GRAPHS TO A COMMON GRAPH-BASED DATA STRUCTURE THAT CAPTURES ALL OF THE DESIRED INFORMATION. THIS COMMON MODEL COULD SUPPORT FURTHER WORK TO DEVELOP DIGITALTWINS. A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO THIS IS THAT THE GRAPHS THAT HAVE CURRENTLY BEEN GENERATED FROM PIDS AND 3D CAD MODELS ARE AT VERY DIFFERENT ABSTRACTION LEVELS, SO GRAPH MATCHING METHODS ARE NOT FEASIBLE. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESS THIS OBSTACLE BY BUILDING ON PREVIOUS WORK, IN WHICH GRAPHS WERE GENERATED FROM PIDS AND 3D CAD MODELS.

"DIGITALTWIN (DT) IS A VIRTUAL MIRROR (REPRESENTATION) OF A PHYSICAL WORLD OR A SYSTEM ALONG ITS LIFECYCLE. AS FOR A COMPLEX DISCRETE MANUFACTURING SYSTEM (DMS), IT IS A DIGITAL MODEL FOR EMULATING OR REPRODUCING THE FUNCTIONS OR ACTIONS OF A REAL MANUFACTURING SYSTEM BY GIVING THE SYSTEM SIMULATION INFORMATION OR DIRECTLY DRIVEN BY A REAL SYSTEM WITH PROPER CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE DT MODEL AND THE REAL-WORLD SYSTEM. IT IS A KEY BUILDING BLOCK FOR SMART FACTORY AND MANUFACTURING UNDER THE INDUSTRYFOURTH PARADIGM. THE KEY RESEARCH QUESTION IS HOW TO EFFECTIVELY CREATE A DT MODEL DURING THE DESIGN STAGE OF A COMPLEX MANUFACTURING SYSTEM AND TO MAKE IT USABLE THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM'S LIFECYCLE SUCH AS THE PRODUCTION STAGE. GIVEN THAT THERE ARE SOME EXISTING DISCUSSIONS ON DT FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT, THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE MODELING METHODS FOR RAPIDLY CREATING A VIRTUAL MODEL AND THE CONNECTION IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISM BETWEEN A PHYSICAL WORLD PRODUCTION SYSTEM AT A WORKSHOP LEVEL AND ITS MIRRORED VIRTUAL MODEL. TO REACH ABOVE GOALS, IN THIS PAPER, THE DISCRETE EVENT SYSTEM (DES) MODELING THEORY IS APPLIED TO THE THREE-DIMENSION DT MODEL. FIRST, FOR FORMALLY REPRESENTING A MANUFACTURING SYSTEM AND CREATING ITS VIRTUAL MODEL, SEVEN BASIC ELEMENTS: CONTROLLER, EXECUTOR, PROCESSOR, BUFFER, FLOWING ENTITY, VIRTUAL SERVICE NODE AND LOGISTICS PATH OF A DMS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND THE CONCEPT OF THE LOGISTICS PATH NETWORK AND THE SERVICE CELL IS INTRODUCED TO UNIFORMLY DESCRIBE A MANUFACTURING SYSTEM. SECOND, FOR IMPLEMENTING INTERCONNECTION AND INTERACTION, A NEW INTERCONNECTION AND DATA INTERACTION MECHANISM BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL SYSTEM AND ITS VIRTUAL MODEL FOR THROUGH-LIFE APPLICATIONS HAS BEEN DESIGNED. WITH THEM, EACH SERVICE CELL CONSISTS OF SEVEN ELEMENTS AND ENCAPSULATES INPUT/OUTPUT INFORMATION AND CONTROL LOGIC. ALL THE DISCRETE CELLS ARE CONSTRUCTED AND MAPPED ONTO DIFFERENT PRODUCTION-PROCESS-ORIENTED DIGITAL MANUFACTURING MODULES BY INTEGRATING LOGICAL, GEOMETRIC AND DATA MODELS.

"IN THE CONTROL OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS, WE OBSERVE TWO DIAMETRICAL TRENDS: MODEL-BASED CONTROL DERIVED FROM DIGITALTWINS, AND MODEL-FREE CONTROL THROUGH AI. THERE ARE ALSO ATTEMPTS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO BY INCORPORATING LEARNING-BASED AI ALGORITHMS INTO DIGITALTWINS TO MITIGATE MISMATCHES BETWEEN THE DIGITALTWIN MODEL AND THE PHYSICAL SYSTEM. ONE OF THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACHES TO THIS IS DIRECT INPUT ADAPTATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE ASK WHETHER IT IS USEFUL TO EMPLOY A GENERIC LEARNING ALGORITHM IN SUCH A SETTING, AND OUR CONCLUSION IS ``NOT VERY ``. WE DENOTE AN ALGORITHM TO BE MORE USEFUL THAN ANOTHER ALGORITHM BASED ON THREE ASPECTS: 1) IT REQUIRES FEWER DATA SAMPLES TO REACH A DESIRED MINIMAL PERFORMANCE, 2) IT ACHIEVES BETTER PERFORMANCE FOR A REASONABLE NUMBER OF DATA SAMPLES, AND 3) IT ACCUMULATES LESS REGRET. IN OUR EVALUATION, WE RANDOMLY SAMPLE PROBLEMS FROM AN INDUSTRIALLY RELEVANT GEOMETRY ASSURANCE CONTEXT AND MEASURE THE AFOREMENTIONED PERFORMANCE INDICATORS OF 16 DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS. OUR CONCLUSION IS THAT BLACKBOX OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS, DESIGNED TO LEVERAGE SPECIFIC PROPERTIES OF THE PROBLEM, GENERALLY PERFORM BETTER THAN GENERIC LEARNING ALGORITHMS, ONCE AGAIN FINDING THAT ``THERE IS NO FREE LUNCH ``. NOTE TO PRACTITIONERS-DIGITALTWINS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND QUALITY IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS SUCH AS MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS.

"IN OUR CONTRIBUTION, WE CONSIDER HOW THE DIGITALTWIN OF THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM CAN BE COMBINED WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHODS. THE RESULT OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD BE A HYBRID PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, WHICH CAN BE USED FOR DECISION SUPPORT AS WELL AS FOR SELF-CONTROL. ON THE ONE HAND, THE DIGITALTWIN IS PROVIDING INFORMATION AND SIMULATION FOR THE OPTIMAL DECISION-MAKING TO THE DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM (HUMAN INTERACTION). ON THE OTHER HAND, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS TAKING OVER SOME ELEMENTS AND TASKS WITH AUTOMATIC CONTROL (INDEPENDENT OF HUMAN INTERACTION). IF THE RESULT IS OUT OF TOLERANCE OR IF A RANDOM SAMPLE OF THE RESULT IS AUDITED, THE DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM IS VALIDATING THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESULT FOR EXECUTION (BY HUMAN INTERACTION). THE HYBRID PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS TO BE USED TO CONTROL PRODUCTION PROCESSES AND GENERATES LEARNING EFFECTS. THE EXTENSION BY METHODS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OPENS POSSIBILITIES TO PROCESS AND TO MASTER CERTAIN TASKS INDEPENDENTLY OF HUMAN INTERACTION. THE PRESENTED APPROACH SHOULD RELIEVE AND SUPPORT DECISION MAKERS IN PRODUCTION. BY PERFORMING VARIOUS ACTIONS AUTOMATICALLY AND ACHIEVING PARTIAL AUTO-CONTROL, THE REACTIVITY OF LINKED PROCESSES CAN INCREASE.

"PHYSICAL ASSETS IN MANUFACTURING, CAN BE: MACHINES, SENSORS, ACTUATORS AND IN GENERAL EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PART OF THE PLANT AND ITS PROCESSES. IN SUCH DOMAIN, THE SEARCH FOR ""AGILITY"" HAS COME TO BE ONE OF THE MOST REQUESTED FEATURES. AS A RESULT, CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO DESIGN MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS WHICH EMBODY MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY. IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT WHERE THE EVOLUTION OF THE SUPPLY-CHAIN BASED CONCEPT OF MINI FACTORIES IS RELEVANT, AS IT ALLOWS A NETWORK-LIKE INTERCONNECTIVITY BETWEEN ASSETS BY SETTING UP FACTORIES INSIDE THE PREMISES OF THE PRINCIPAL MANUFACTURER. IT IS STATED THAT AT THE CORE OF INDUSTRYFOURTH IMPLEMENTATION, EVERY ASSET (E.G. A MACHINE, SOFTWARE, SENSOR OR ACTUATOR, ETC.), SHOULD BE MODELED VIA AN ASSET ADMINISTRATIVE SHELL (AAS). AAS IS A KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSET, ITS TECHNICAL FUNCTIONALITY AND ITS RELATIONSHIPS TO OTHER ASSETS. IT CAN BE VIEWED AS THE BRIDGE BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL WORLD AND THE IOT WORLD OR, IN OTHER WORDS, THE DATA MODEL FROM WHERE THE DIGITALTWIN STEMS FROM.

AS HEALTHCARE DELIVERY ORGANIZATIONS GEAR FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, IT MUST MEET THE INCREASED DEMANDS TO DELIVER ACCURATE DIGITALTWINS ASSISTANCE IN REDUCING HUMAN INTERVENTION IN ALMOST EVERY DOMAIN. IN SIMPLE TERMS, A DIGITALTWIN IS A VIRTUAL COPY OF A TANGIBLE ENTITY (SUCH AS VEHICLE ENGINES OR PEOPLE) OR AN INTANGIBLE SYSTEM (LIKE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES OR MARKETING SYSTEMS) THAT CAN BE ANALYZED INDEPENDENTLY OF ITS REAL-WORLD COUNTERPART IN ORDER TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. NASA EMPLOYED A SIMILAR CONCEPT. IT HAD PHYSICAL REPLICAS OF ITS SPACECRAFTS ON EARTH WHILE THE ACTUAL ONES WERE IN OUTER SPACE.

"MANUFACTURING COMPANIES ACROSS ALL MAJOR INDUSTRIES ARE FACING SERIOUS CHALLENGES TRYING TO COMPETITIVELY DESIGN AND MANAGE MODERN PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMPLEX MULTI-DOMAIN SYSTEMS OR ``SYSTEMS OF SYSTEMS''. MODEL-BASED SYSTEMS DRIVEN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (OR SDPD, FOR SYSTEMS DRIVEN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT) HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A SOLUTION BASED ON DRIVING THE PRODUCT LIFECYCLE FROM THE SYSTEMS REQUIREMENTS AND TRACING BACK PERFORMANCE TO STAKEHOLDERS' NEEDS THROUGH A RFLP (REQUIREMENT, FUNCTIONAL, LOGICAL, PHYSICAL) TRACEABILITY PROCESS. THE SDPD FRAMEWORK INTEGRATES SYSTEM BEHAVIORAL MODELING WITH DOWNSTREAM PRODUCT DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS PRACTICES TO SUPPORT THE VERIFICATION/VALIDATION OF THE SYSTEMS BEHAVIOR AS PRODUCTS PROGRESS THROUGH ALL PHASES OF THE LIFECYCLE, AS WELL AS THE OPTIMIZATION OF TRADE-OFFS DECISIONS BY MAINTAINING THE CROSS-PRODUCT DIGITALTWIN AND THREAD FOR GLOBAL DECISION OPTIMIZATION IN AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WAY. WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE DIGITAL MANUFACTURING CURRICULUM (DESIGNED AROUND THE SDPD PARADIGM) THAT IS BASED ON THE DIGITALIZATION OF THE SE (SYSTEMS ENGINEERING) PROCESS THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF MODELLING AND SIMULATION CONTINUUM, IN THE FORM OF MODEL-BASED SYSTEMS ENGINEERING (MBSE), WITH PRODUCT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT (PLM). AT THE CORE OF THIS CURRICULUM IS A SHIFT OF FOCUS FROM THEORY TO IMPLEMENTATION AND PRACTICE, THROUGH AN APPLIED SYNTHESIS OF ENGINEERING FUNDAMENTALS AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING, THAT IS DRIVEN BY A STATE-OF-THE-ART DIGITAL INNOVATION PLATFORM FOR PRODUCT (OR SYSTEM) DEVELOPMENT CONSISTING OF INTEGRATED SOFTWARE (DIGITAL) TOOLS SPANNING THE COMPLETE LIFECYCLE. THE CURRICULUM CONSISTS OF THREE KEY COMPONENTS, NAMELY, MODELLING AND SIMULATION CONTINUUM, TRACEABILITY, AND DIGITAL THREAD. THE CURRICULUM PROVIDES A FOUNDATION FOR IMPLEMENTING THE DIGITALTWIN AND SUPPORTS THE TRAINING OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF ENGINEERS FOR INDUSTRYFOURTH. THE DIGITAL MANUFACTURING (OR SDPD) FRAMEWORK IS APPLIED IN THE DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION OF AN ELECTRIC SKATEBOARD. THE IMPLEMENTATION DEMONSTRATES: 1) THE BENEFITS OF DIGITALIZATION/MODEL-BASED ENGINEERING WHEN DEVELOPING COMPLEX MULTI-DOMAIN PRODUCTS OR SYSTEMS; 2) THE ABILITY OF STUDENTS TO EFFECTIVELY COMPLETE A REAL-LIFE MODERN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE TIME LINE OF ONE SEMESTER; 3) THE PROVISION OF MBSE CURRICULUM FOR ENGINEERING EDUCATION 4.0, CHARACTERIZED BY KEY, INTEGRATED SKILLS FOR THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE AND INDUSTRYFOURTH.

TO FACILITATE THE SELF-DIAGNOSIS AND ADAPTIVE ABILITY IN SMART MILLING SYSTEM, A DIGITALTWIN–DRIVEN INTELLIGENT ALGORITHM FOR MONITORING IN-PROCESS MILLING PARAMETERS IS PROPOSED HERE. THE ALGORITHM CAN EXTRACT THE RADIAL WIDTH OF CUT, AXIAL DEPTH OF CUT, CUTTER RUNOUT PARAMETERS, AND CUTTING CONSTANTS IN THE END MILLING PROCESS AT THE SAME TIME ONLY BY USING FORCE SENSOR. IT IS AN IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH IN THIS PAPER TO CONVERGE TWO DIFFERENT FORCE MODELS TO REALIZE CYBER-PHYSICAL FUSION FOR IDENTIFYING MILLING PARAMETERS IN THE MILLING PROCESS. BY USING THE CONVOLUTION FORCE MODEL, DIGITALTWIN TECHNOLOGY CAN EXTRACT THE APPROXIMATE SOLUTION OF MILLING PARAMETERS IN THE MACHINING PROCESS IN ADVANCE, SO AS TO NARROW THE RANGE OF SOLUTION. FURTHERMORE, THE SUBSEQUENT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHM CAN FIND THE ACCURATE SOLUTION OF THE CURRENT MILLING PARAMETERS IN A SHORT CALCULATION TIME BY CYBER-PHYSICAL FUSION WITH THE NUMERICAL FORCE MODEL CONSIDERING CUTTER RUNOUT EFFECT.

"IN MODERN INDUSTRY, THE AUTONOMY IN RESPONDING TO THREATS IS A HIGHLY VALUED FEATURE OF MACHINES. THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY COLLECT AND PROCESS DATA ON THE CONDITION OF EQUIPMENT AND EVENTS IN ITS ENVIRONMENT IS THE BASIS FOR MANY SECURITY OR ALARM SOLUTIONS. HOWEVER, SOME COMPONENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM ONGOING MONITORING DUE TO DIFFICULTIES IN PLACING AND OPERATING SENSORS IN THEIR AREA. THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS CAUSES DIAGNOSTIC METHODS TO BE DEVELOPED IN THE DIRECTION OF INFERRING ABOUT GIVEN DAMAGE WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO SIGNALS CLEARLY RELATED TO SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS. ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF INDUSTRYFOURTH – A DIGITALTWIN – MAY BE HELPFUL IN THIS AREA. THE ADVANTAGES OF SUCH A SOLUTION CAN BE OBSERVED ON THE EXAMPLE OF VIRTUAL REPRESENTATION OF THE TOOTHED BELT DRIVE. THE PUBLICATION DESCRIBES A PROPOSAL TO USE A DYNAMIC MODEL OF A DEVICE FOR THE INDUCTION OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE BEHAVIOUR OF A FLEXIBLE TRANSMITTING ELEMENT ONLY ON THE BASIS OF THE RECORDING OF THE INPUT AND OUTPUT MOTIONS IN THE MECHANISM UNDER CONSIDERATION. THE TRANSMISSION IS TREATED AS A “BLACK BOX”, WHICH CAN BE ACCESSED THROUGH A COMPUTER SIMULATION. THIS ALLOWS ONE TO DETERMINE THE CONDITION OF THE TOOTHED BELT, WHICH STRENGTH TRANSLATES INTO THE RELIABILITY OF THE MACHINE.

"ACCURATE PREDICTION OF MACHINING CYCLE TIMES IS IMPORTANT IN THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. USUALLY, COMPUTER-AIDED MANUFACTURING (CAM) SOFTWARE ESTIMATES THE MACHINING TIMES USING THE COMMANDED FEEDRATE FROM THE TOOLPATH FILE USING BASIC KINEMATIC SETTINGS. TYPICALLY, THE METHODS DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR TOOLPATH GEOMETRY OR TOOLPATH TOLERANCE AND THEREFORE UNDERESTIMATE THE MACHINING CYCLE TIMES CONSIDERABLY. REMOVING THE NEED FOR MACHINE-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A DATA-DRIVEN FEEDRATE AND MACHINING CYCLE TIME PREDICTION METHOD BY BUILDING A NEURAL NETWORK MODEL FOR EACH MACHINE TOOL AXIS. IN THIS STUDY, DATASETS COMPOSED OF THE COMMANDED FEEDRATE, NOMINAL ACCELERATION, TOOLPATH GEOMETRY AND THE MEASURED FEEDRATE WERE USED TO TRAIN A NEURAL NETWORK MODEL.

AMONG THESE COMPONENTS, THE PROCESSING COMPONENT IS THE MOST CRITICAL ONE THAT DIGITALLY MODELS, SIMULATES, AND VALIDATES A GIVEN PHENOMENON EXTRACTING INFORMATION FROM THE INPUT COMPONENT. WHAT KIND OF MODELING, SIMULATION, AND VALIDATION APPROACHES SHOULD BE USED WHILE CONSTRUCTING THE PROCESSING COMPONENT FOR A GIVEN PHENOMENON IS A RESEARCH QUESTION.

CONSEQUENTLY, IT GAINS VALUE BY FEEDING IT RELEVANT DATA. HOWEVER, DEFINING THE CORRECT USE CASES FOR DIGITALTWINS MAY POSE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. THEREFORE, THIS CONCEPT PAPER PRESENTS A METHOD FOR USE CASE RELATED VIEWS OF DIGITALTWINS. IT SUPPORTS THE DEFINITION OF USE CASES THAT ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE DIGITALTWIN AS USE CASE RELATED VIEWS.

"THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IS CHANGING THE WAY INDUSTRIES FACE THEIR PROBLEMS, INCLUDING MAINTENANCE. THE RAILWAY INDUSTRY IS MOVING TO ADOPT THIS NEW INDUSTRY MODEL. THE NEW TRAINS ARE DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, AND MAINTAINED FOLLOWING AN INDUSTRYFOURTH METHODOLOGY, BUT MOST OF THE CURRENT TRAINS IN OPERATION WERE NOT DESIGNED WITH THIS TECHNOLOGICAL PHILOSOPHY, SO THEY MUST BE ADAPTED TO IT. IN THIS PAPER, A NEW METHODOLOGY FOR ADAPTING A HIGH-SPEED TRAIN TO INDUSTRYFOURTH IS PROPOSED. THAT WAY, A TRAIN MANUFACTURED BEFORE THIS NEW PARADIGM CAN SEIZE THE ADVANTAGES OF MAINTENANCE 4.0. THIS METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON FOUR STAGES (PHYSICAL SYSTEM, DIGITALTWIN, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, AND DIAGNOSIS) THAT COMPRISE THE REQUIRED PROCESSES TO DIGITALIZE A RAILWAY VEHICLE AND THAT SHARE INFORMATION BETWEEN THEM. THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT THE DATA ACQUISITION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS MUST FULFIL ARE DESCRIBED, AS WELL AS THE ORIGINAL SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED FOR ANALYSING VIBRATION SIGNALS. THESE TECHNIQUES ALLOW PROCESSING EXPERIMENTAL DATA BOTH IN REAL TIME AND DEFERRED, ACCORDING TO ACTUAL MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS. THE METHODOLOGY IS APPLIED TO DETERMINE THE OPERATING CONDITION OF A HIGH-SPEED BOGIE BY COMBINING THE SIGNAL PROCESSING OF ACTUAL VIBRATION MEASUREMENTS TAKEN DURING THE NORMAL TRAIN OPERATION AND THE DATA OBTAINED FROM SIMULATIONS OF THE DIGITALTWIN. THE COMBINATION OF BOTH (EXPERIMENTAL DATA AND SIMULATIONS) ALLOWS ESTABLISHING CHARACTERISTIC INDICATORS THAT CORRESPOND TO THE NORMAL RUNNING OF THE TRAIN AND INDICATORS THAT WOULD CORRESPOND TO ANOMALIES IN THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE TRAIN. © 2021 THE AUTHOR(S) 2021.",METHODOLOGY FOR THE INTEGRATION OF A HIGHSPEED TRAIN IN MAINTENANCE 40
"PURPOSE: THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXAMINE THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL (TAM) IN THE FIELD OF MIXED REALITY AND DIGITALTWIN (MRDT) AND IDENTIFY KEY FACTORS AFFECTING USERS' INTENTIONS TO USE MRDT. THE FACTORS ARE USED AS A SET OF KEY METRICS FOR PROPOSING A PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR VIRTUAL, AUGMENTED AND MIXED REALITY (MR) ACCEPTANCE BY USERS. THIS MODEL IS CALLED THE EXTENDED TAM FOR MRDT ADOPTION IN THE ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING, CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONS (AECO) INDUSTRY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: AN INTERPRETIVIST PHILOSOPHICAL LENS WAS ADOPTED TO CONDUCT AN INDUCTIVE SYSTEMATIC AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS OF SECONDARY DATA CONTAINED WITHIN PUBLISHED JOURNAL ARTICLES THAT FOCUSED UPON MRDT ACCEPTANCE MODELLING. THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES (PRISMA) APPROACH TO META-ANALYSIS WERE ADOPTED TO ENSURE ALL KEY INVESTIGATIONS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL DATABASE SET. QUANTITY INDICATORS SUCH AS PATH COEFFICIENTS, FACTOR RANKING, CRONBACH’S ALPHA (A) AND CHI-SQUARE (B) TEST, COUPLED WITH CONTENT ANALYSIS, WERE USED FOR EXAMINING THE DATABASE CONSTRUCTED. THE DATABASE INCLUDED JOURNAL PAPERS FROM 2010 TO 2020. FINDINGS: THE EXTANT LITERATURE REVEALED THAT THE MOST COMMONLY USED CONSTRUCTS OF THE MRDT–TAM INCLUDED: SUBJECTIVE NORM; SOCIAL INFLUENCE; PERCEIVED EASE OF USE (PEOU); PERCEIVED SECURITY; PERCEIVED ENJOYMENT; SATISFACTION; PERCEIVED USEFULNESS (PU); ATTITUDE; AND BEHAVIOURAL INTENTION (BI). USING THESE IDENTIFIED CONSTRUCTS, THE GENERAL EXTENDED TAM FOR MRDT IN THE AECO INDUSTRY IS DEVELOPED. OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS SUCH AS “PERCEIVED IMMERSION” COULD BE ADDED TO THE OBTAINED MODEL. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THE DECISION TO UTILISE A NEW TECHNOLOGY IS DIFFICULT AND HIGH RISK IN THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT CONTEXT, DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF MRDT TECHNOLOGIES AND DYNAMIC CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENT. THE OUTCOME OF THE DECISION MAY AFFECT EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE, PROJECT PRODUCTIVITY AND ON-SITE SAFETY. THE EXTENDED ACCEPTANCE MODEL OFFERS A SET OF FACTORS THAT ASSIST MANAGERS OR PRACTITIONERS IN MAKING EFFECTIVE DECISIONS FOR UTILISING ANY TYPE OF MRDT TECHNOLOGY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: SEVERAL CONSTRAINTS ARE APPARENT DUE TO THE LIMITED INVESTIGATION OF MRDT EVALUATION MATRICES AND EMPIRICAL STUDIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE RESEARCH ONLY COVERS TECHNOLOGIES WHICH HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE, RELATING TO VIRTUAL REALITY (VR), AUGMENTED REALITY (AR), MR, DT AND SENSORS, SO NEWER TECHNOLOGIES MAY NOT BE INCLUDED. MOREOVER, THE REVIEW PROCESS COULD SPAN A LONGER TIME PERIOD AND THUS EMBRACE A FULLER SPECTRUM OF TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN THESE DIFFERENT AREAS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE RESEARCH PROVIDES A THEORETICAL MODEL FOR MEASURING AND EVALUATING MRDT ACCEPTANCE AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL IN THE AECO CONTEXT AND SIGNPOSTS FUTURE RESEARCH RELATED TO MRDT ADOPTION IN THE AECO INDUSTRY, AS WELL AS PROVIDING MANAGERIAL GUIDANCE FOR PROGRESSIVE AECO PROFESSIONALS WHO SEEK TO EXPAND THEIR USE OF MRDT IN THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION (4IR).

THIS ALLOWS LED VENDORS TO SHARE THEM WITH END-USERS WITHOUT DISCLOSING THEIR SENSITIVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. MAJOR STEPS CONSIST OF 1) CHARACTERIZING THE PHYSICAL LED IN A STANDARDIZED WAY THAT COMBINES THERMAL/ELECTRICAL/OPTICAL TESTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH COMBINED TESTING STANDARDS (JESD 51-51, JESD 51-52, JESD 51-14, CIE 225:2017); 2) REPORTING THE CHARACTERIZED SETS OF DATA (CURRENT-VOLTAGE-LUMINOUS FLUX (IVL) AND THERMAL IMPEDANCE CHARACTERISTICS) IN A STANDARDIZED WAY; 3) GENERATING THE MDCM LED FROM THE SET OF DATA; 4) COUPLING THE MDCM LED TO A 3D LUMINAIRE CFD (COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS) MODEL.

"DIGITALTWINS ARE ONE OF THE KEY TECHNOLOGIES BEHIND THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. IN THE COMING YEARS THEY WILL BE INTRODUCED ON A LARGE SCALE IN THE INDUSTRY AND IN OTHER SPHERES. A WIDE RANGE OF DIGITALTWINS WILL BE IN DEMAND: FROM SEPARATE COMPONENTS TO COMPLEX TECHNICAL FACILITIES, SUCH AS AUTOMOBILES, AIRPLANES, MANUFACTURING LINES, FACTORIES, CORPORATIONS, ETC. TO PROVIDE THEIR SUCCESSFUL INTERACTION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CREATE DIGITALTWINS ON THE UNIFORM PRINCIPLES. CURRENTLY, CREATING A DIGITALTWIN IS A COMPLEX SCIENTIFIC ISSUE. IT PRESENTS DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE IT IS NECESSARY NOT ONLY TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL (OR CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, ETC.) PROCESSES GOING ON IN THE OBJECT, BUT ALSO TO ENVISAGE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OF ITS PROPERTIES IN THE COURSE OF ITS OPERATION. IN THIS CASE THE DIGITALTWIN IS SUPPOSED TO ADAPT TO THE CHANGES IN THE ORIGINAL OBJECT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DATA RECEIVED FROM THE SENSORS. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO DEFINE THE STRATEGIES OF SOLVING THE CURRENT PROBLEMS IN SUCH AREAS AS DIGITALTWINS, THE INTERNET OF THINGS AND CYBERPHYSICAL SYSTEMS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS AIM, THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SOLVED: - CONSIDER THE DEFINITIONS OF THE DIGITALTWIN SUGGESTED IN THE WORLD SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE - FIND A UNIFIED DATA-DRIVEN REAL-TIME APPROACH TO CREATING DIGITALTWINS - SUGGEST USING THE NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH IN CREATING DIGITALTWINS. DURING THE USE OF THE MODELLED OBJECT, SPECIFICS OF THE PHYSICAL PROCESSES GOING ON IN IT AND OBJECT PROPERTIES CAN CHANGE. THE MODEL IS SUPPOSED TO ADAPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE CHANGES, WHICH IS RATHER DIFFICULT IF A MODEL IS GENERATED BY APPLYING COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING SOFTWARE PACKAGES (CAE) BASED ON CLASSICAL NUMERICAL METHODS.

"THE USE OF SMART DEVICES HAS INCREASED GREATLY IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WITH USERS REACHING OUT TO THE POSSIBILITY TO DO MORE WITH THEM ESPECIALLY IN THE NETWORKING FRONT. IN THIS CONTEXT THERE IS A NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN USERS’ SOCIAL DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, THEIR WAY TO RELATED TO THEIR SMART DEVICES, AND THE INCREASING ADOPTION SMART TECHNOLOGIES IN THE INDUSTRYFOURTH DOMAINS. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE SENSO OF BELONGING OF A COMMUNITY USING SMART DEVICES. IN THIS WAY WE EVALUATE INTANGIBLE BENEFITS THAT EMPLOYEES MAY GAIN FROM A MORE IMMERSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR DEVICES. WE USED A DATASET OF 586 ANONYMOUS RESPONDENT OF AN EXISTING SURVEY DESIGNED FOR CAPTURING THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT HUMANS DEVELOP WITH THEIR SMART DEVICES. IN PARTICULAR, WE INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SMART DEVICE AND PARTICULAR BACKGROUND VARIABLES OF THE RESPONDENTS USING A CHI-SQUARE TEST. THE STUDY SHOWED THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN USERS’ SEX AND SMART DEVICE TYPE AND THEIR DEPENDENCY ON SMART DEVICE. BOTH MALE AND FEMALES, TENDS TO THINK THAT SMART DEVICE ENABLES THEM TO CONNECT WITH A LARGER COMMUNITY AND SMART PHONE USERS CONNECT MORE TO LARGE COMMUNITY THAN OTHER SMART DEVICES USERS. THIS STUDY PROVIDED SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS THAT STRENGTHEN THE PREVIOUS LITERATURE WORKS ON SUBJECT MATTER.

"AUTONOMY HAS BECOME A FOCAL POINT FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN MANY INDUSTRIES. WHILST THIS WAS TRADITIONALLY ACHIEVED BY MODELLING SELF-ENGINEERING BEHAVIOURS AT THE COMPONENT-LEVEL, EFFORTS ARE NOW BEING FOCUSED ON THE SUB-SYSTEM AND SYSTEM-LEVEL THROUGH ADVANCEMENTS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. EXPLOITING ITS BENEFITS REQUIRES SOME INNOVATIVE THINKING TO INTEGRATE OVERARCHING CONCEPTS FROM BIG DATA ANALYSIS, DIGITISATION, SENSING, OPTIMISATION, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING. WITH RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INDUSTRYFOURTH, MACHINE LEARNING AND DIGITALTWIN, THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING INTEREST IN ADAPTING THESE CONCEPTS TO ACHIEVE AUTONOMOUS MAINTENANCE; THE AUTOMATION OF PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING DIRECTLY FROM OPERATIONAL DATA AND FOR IN-BUILT REPAIR AT THE SYSTEMS-LEVEL. HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL AMBIGUITY WHETHER STATE-OF-THE-ART DEVELOPMENTS ARE TRULY AUTONOMOUS OR THEY SIMPLY AUTOMATE A PROCESS. IN LIGHT OF THIS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO PRESENT THE CURRENT PERSPECTIVES ABOUT WHERE THE TECHNOLOGY STANDS TODAY AND INDICATE POSSIBLE ROUTES FOR THE FUTURE. AS A RESULT, THIS EFFORT FOCUSES ON RECENT TRENDS IN AUTONOMOUS MAINTENANCE BEFORE MOVING ON TO DISCUSS DIGITALTWIN AS A VEHICLE FOR DECISION MAKING FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF REQUIREMENTS, WHILST THE ROLE OF AI IN ASSISTING WITH THIS PROCESS IS ALSO EXPLORED.

"THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES THE CONCEPTS AND IDEAS BEHIND INDUSTRYFOURTH AND DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF SIMULATION AND SIMULATION STANDARDS FOR IMPLEMENTING IT. WE ARGUE THAT THE SUCCESS OF INDUSTRYFOURTH HIGHLY DEPENDS ON THE SUCCESS OF INTERCONNECTED CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS) WHICH CAN ONLY BE IMPLEMENTED WITH UP-FRONT SIMULATION. THIS UPFRONT SIMULATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF CPS IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERM OF BUILDING THE “DIGITALTWIN” FOR THE RESPECTIVE CPS. DIGITALTWINS ARE TYPICALLY DEFINED AS DIGITAL REPRESENTATIONS WHICH REPRESENT THE REAL SYSTEM AND ITS CURRENT STATE IN A DIGITAL MODEL. FOR INVESTIGATING THEIR DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR, DIGITALTWINS MUST HAVE PROPERTIES TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SIMULATION MODELS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE DISCUSS REQUIREMENTS AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITALTWINS AS WELL AS THE IMPLICATIONS THAT THIS HAS ON SIMULATION STANDARDS. AS AN EXAMPLE, DIGITALTWINS AS REPRESENTATIONS OF A CPS WILL HAVE THE NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER DIGITALTWINS; HENCE A MODULAR APPROACH FOR BUILDING FEDERATIONS OF DIGITALTWINS IS NEEDED. BEYOND THAT, ALSO A NEED FOR STANDARDIZED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DIGITALTWIN AND THE REAL CPS ARISES.

"THE DIGITALTWIN CONCEPT, AS THE CUTTING EDGE OF DIGITAL MANUFACTURING SOLUTION FOR MODERN INDUSTRIES, PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE INDUSTRYFOURTH ERA. ONE KEY ENABLING TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPING A DT IS THE INFORMATION MODELING OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, SO AS TO COMBINE THE PHYSICAL WORLD WITH THE CYBERSPACE MORE EXTENSIVELY AND CLOSELY. THEREFORE, THE MODELING APPROACH TO MANAGING AS-FABRICATED DATA OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, WHICH FAITHFULLY REFLECTS THE PRODUCT'S PHYSICAL STATUS, EMERGES TO BE PIVOTAL. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF MODELING AS-FABRICATED PARTS IN THE MACHINING PROCESS, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH BY RELEVANT METHODS, AND HINDERS THE LONG-TERM DATA ARCHIVING AND REUSE OF PROCESS DATA. FURTHERMORE, TO FILL THE GAP, AN ONTOLOGY-BASED INFORMATION MODELING METHOD OF AS-FABRICATED PARTS IS PROPOSED AS THE RECOMMENDATION TO CREATE DTS FOR AS-FABRICATED PARTS. IT PROVIDES A SIMPLE AND STANDARDIZED PROCESS FOR COMPANIES TO CREATE DTS OF AS-FABRICATED PARTS BY SPECIFYING THE INFORMATION CLASSIFICATION, THE CONTENTS TO BE MODELED AND THE MODELING METHOD.

"CONDITION MONITORING OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE ERA OF INDUSTRYFOURTH AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS. THE USE OF CONDITION MONITORING ENABLES SOFT SENSING OF INDIRECTLY MEASURABLE OR NON-MEASURABLE PRODUCTION INDICATORS, E.G., CUTTING FORCES, AS THE FOUNDATION FOR A DIGITAL SHADOW OR DIGITALTWIN POWERED BY EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) AND EDGE COMPUTING TECHNIQUES. HENCE, WHEN PROPERLY APPLIED, IT LEADS TO AN IMPROVEMENT IN PROCESS UNDERSTANDING, PRODUCTION PLANNING, QUALITY CONTROL, AND PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE. DESPITE THESE MERITS, THE ADAPTABILITY AND RELIABILITY OF CONDITION MONITORING AT THE PRODUCTION FIELD LEVEL ARE LIMITED BY THE MODELING UNCERTAINTIES DUE TO THE RAPIDLY CHANGING INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT DRIVEN BY DYNAMIC CUSTOMER DEMANDS. THIS STUDY PRESENTS A NOVEL STRATEGY TO OVERCOME THESE SHORTCOMINGS BY EMPLOYING MACHINE INTERNAL SIGNALS AND PRIOR KNOWLEDGE-EMBEDDED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES. A CONCEPT OF INCORPORATING PRODUCTION DOMAIN-SPECIFIC PHYSICAL MODELS AND LOGICAL RULES INTO GENERALIZED DATA-DRIVEN METHODS IS PROPOSED. A HYBRID LEARNING FORCE MODEL BASED ON MACHINE INTERNAL SIGNALS WAS CONSTRUCTED. AS A RESULT, THE SOFT SENSOR ENCOMPASSES STOCHASTIC EFFECTS THAT ARE NEGLECTED IN THE EXISTING MODEL AND ESTIMATES THE RELIABILITY OF THE MODELED FINDINGS. PROSPECTIVELY, THIS ALLOWS FOR ONLINE PARAMETRIZATION OF THE MODEL WITHIN DYNAMICALLY CHANGING CONDITIONS.

"DRIVEN BY TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND INCREASING CUSTOMER DEMANDS, THE COMPLEXITY IN MANUFACTURING COMPANIES IS RAPIDLY GROWING. TO MANAGE THIS COMPLEXITY NUMEROUS ARCHITECTURE STANDARDIZATION INITIATIVES ARE EMERGING IN THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY, E.G. PRODUCTION PLATFORMS, REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE MODEL INDUSTRYFOURTH (RAMI4.0), INDUSTRIAL INTERNET REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE (IIRA). LARGE MANUFACTURING COMPANIES ARE CHANGING THEIR APPROACH TOWARDS MANAGING PRODUCTION AND ARE ADOPTING THE CONCEPT OF PRODUCTION PLATFORMS. PRODUCTION PLATFORMS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS A SET OF SUBSYSTEMS AND INTERFACES TO CREATE A COMMON ARCHITECTURE TO DEVELOP BOTH PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION SYSTEMS SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODELS REQUIRED IN THESE PLATFORMS IS OFTEN PERFORMED MANUALLY AND IT IS PERCEIVED AS VERY TIME CONSUMING. A DISCIPLINE THAT CAN SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PRODUCTION PLATFORMS IS ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE (EA). EA IS A DISCIPLINE THAT MANAGES THE ORGANIZING LOGIC OF THE ENTERPRISE AND IT REFLECTS THE INTEGRATION AND STANDARDIZATION REQUIREMENTS OF ITS OPERATING MODEL. THEREFORE MODELLING THE PRODUCTS, PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AND PROCESS IS IN THE SCOPE OF EA WHEN APPLIED TO THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. IN THIS PAPER, WE DEVELOP A NEW AUTOMATED EA MODELLING METHOD RELEVANT ALSO FOR MANUFACTURING. WE TESTED IT IN AN INDUSTRYFOURTH LABORATORY.

BAYESIAN DECISION NETWORKS ARE A RECOGNIZED TOOL TO CONTROL THE EFFECTS OF CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES IN SUCH SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, DETERMINING WHETHER A MANUFACTURING PROCESS IS OUT OF RANGE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT COMPUTATION TIME FOR A DECISION NETWORK, THUS DELAYING THE TRIGGERING OF A MALFUNCTION ALARM. FROM ITS ORIGINS, JIDOKA WAS CONCEIVED AS A MEANS TO PROVIDE MECHANISMS TO FACILITATE REAL-TIME IDENTIFICATION OF MALFUNCTIONS IN ANY STEP OF THE PROCESS, SO THAT THE PRODUCTION LINE COULD BE STOPPED, THE CAUSE OF THE DISRUPTION IDENTIFIED FOR RESOLUTION, AND ULTIMATELY THE NUMBER OF DEFECTIVE PARTS MINIMIZED. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT WE CAN MODEL THE INTERNAL SENSOR NETWORK OF A COMPUTER NUMERICAL CONTROL (CNC) MACHINE WITH QUANTUM SIMULATIONS THAT SHOW BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN CLASSICAL MODELS BASED ON DECISION NETWORKS. WE SHOW A SUCCESSFUL TEST OF OUR HYPOTHESIS BY IMPLEMENTING A QUANTUM DIGITALTWIN THAT ALLOWS FOR THE INTEGRATION OF QUANTUM COMPUTING AND INDUSTRYFOURTH. THIS QUANTUM DIGITALTWIN SIMULATES THE INTRICATE SENSOR NETWORK WITHIN A MACHINE AND PERMITS, DUE TO ITS HIGH COMPUTATIONAL PERFORMANCE, TO APPLY JIDOKA IN REAL TIME WITHIN MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

"A DIGITALTWIN IS THE VIRTUAL REPLICA OF A PHYSICAL SYSTEM. DIGITALTWINS ARE USEFUL BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE MODELS AND DATA FOR DESIGN, PRODUCTION, OPERATION, DIAGNOSTICS, AND PROGNOSTICS OF MACHINES AND PRODUCTS. TRADITIONALLY, BUILDING A DIGITALTWIN REQUIRES MANY BUILT-IN SENSORS TO MONITOR VARIOUS PHYSICAL PHENOMENA ASSOCIATED WITH CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS SUCH AS VIBRATION, ENERGY CONSUMPTION, ETC. HOWEVER, MANY LEGACY MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS DO NOT HAVE MULTI-PHYSICS SENSORS BUILT-IN BY DEFAULT. MOREOVER, IT MIGHT NOT BE FEASIBLE TO INTRUSIVELY PLACE SENSORS IN THESE SYSTEMS AFTER THEY ARE MANUFACTURED. TO BRING THE ADVANTAGES OF DIGITALIZATION TO LEGACY MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS, THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES WITH AN INTERNET-OF-THINGS (IOT) BASED METHODOLOGY TO BUILD DIGITALTWINS USING AN INDIRECT MEDIUM SUCH AS SIDE-CHANNELS, WHICH CAN LOCALIZE ANOMALOUS FAULTS AND INFER THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCTS BEING MANUFACTURED WHILE KEEPING ITSELF UP-TO-DATE. WE ACHIEVE THIS BY EXPLORING AND UTILIZING THE SIDE-CHANNELS (EMISSIONS SUCH AS ACOUSTICS, POWER, MAGNETIC, ETC.) OF THE SYSTEM THAT UNINTENTIONALLY REVEAL THE CYBER AND PHYSICAL STATE OF THE SYSTEM. TO VALIDATE OUR METHODOLOGY, IN THIS PAPER, WE FOCUS ON BUILDING A DIGITALTWIN MODEL OF A FUSED-DEPOSITION MODELING (FDM) BASED CARTESIAN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY ACHIEVES 83.09% ACCURACY IN ANOMALY LOCALIZATION.

THE AIM OF THE PAPER IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE READINESS OF THE ENTERPRISE TO USE INDUSTRYFOURTH. IN THE RESEARCH, A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT ON A SAMPLE OF 276 ENTERPRISES MAINLY FROM THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. USING EXPLORATIVE FACTOR ANALYSIS, THE INDEX OF INDUSTRYFOURTH (VPI4) WAS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF INDUSTRYFOURTH IMPLEMENTATION IN THE ENTERPRISES. THE RESULTS WERE FURTHER VERIFIED BY A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, USING MANN-WHITNEY TEST AND CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE VPI4 INDEX WAS CONSISTENT IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTION WHEN COMPARING THE RESULTS ON THE VERIFICATION SAMPLE. ITS RESULTS CORRELATE WITH THE SUBJECTIVE PERCEPTION OF THE ENTERPRISES, AND DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE INDEX REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE IN TECHNOLOGICAL INTENSITY OF THE INDUSTRY. THE VPI4 INDEX ENABLES THE ENTERPRISES TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN LEVEL OF CURRENT STATE OF READINESS FOR INDUSTRYFOURTH, TO BETTER PRIORITIZE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT.

"A KEY REQUIREMENT FOR AN INTEGRATED DIGITAL TOOL CHAIN IS SECURE ACCESS AND CONTROL OF DATA ASSETS. NOT ALL STAKEHOLDERS WILL HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO OR CONTROL OVER THE FLOW OF INFORMATION, SOME WILL BE ABLE TO INPUT OR CHANGE DATA WHILST OTHERS WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO READ THE DATA.

"WITH THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITALTWIN TECHNOLOGY, A LARGE AMOUNT OF DIGITALTWIN DATA NAMED AS BIG DIGITALTWIN DATA (BDTD), IS GENERATED IN THE LIFECYCLE OF EQUIPMENT, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED IN DIGITALTWIN ENABLED APPLICATIONS.

IT IS A NOVEL WAY TO INTRODUCE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY INTO DIGITALTWIN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. HOWEVER, CURRENT METHODS CANNOT FULFILL THE REQUIREMENTS OF EXPONENTIAL GROWTH AND TIMELY SHARING OF BDTD. THEREFORE, A BLOCKCHAIN-BASED FRAMEWORK FOR SECURE SHARING OF BDTD IS PROPOSED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. CLOUD STORAGE IS INTEGRATED INTO THE FRAMEWORK, WITH WHICH, BDTD IS ENCRYPTED AND STORED IN CLOUD, WHILE THE HASH OF BDTD AND TRANSACTION RECORDS ARE STORED IN BLOCKCHAIN. SOME RULES OF GENERATING NEW BLOCK ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE PROCESSING SPEED OF BLOCKCHAIN. AN ALGORITHM FOR OPTIMAL SAMPLING RATE SELECTION IS PRESENTED TO MAXIMIZE TOTAL SOCIAL BENEFITS OF THE PARTICIPANTS OF BDTD SHARING. SIMULATION RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ALGORITHM IS BETTER THAN TRADITIONAL METHOD FOR MAXIMIZING THE TOTAL SOCIAL BENEFITS. FURTHERMORE, A PROTYPE SYSTEM IS DEVELOPED AND EVALUATED BASED ON FABRIC TEST NETWORK.

"DIGITALTWINS (DTS) HAVE BEEN GAINING POPULARITY IN VARIOUS APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS SMARTMANUFACTURING, SMART ENERGY, SMART MOBILITY, AND SMART HEALTHCARE. IN SIMPLE TERMS, DT IS DESCRIBED AS A VIRTUAL REPLICA OF A GIVEN PHYSICAL PRODUCT, SYSTEM, OR PROCESS. IT CONSISTS OF THREE MAJOR SEGMENTS: THE PHYSICAL ENTITY, ITS VIRTUAL COUNTERPART, AND THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM. WHILE THE DATA IS COLLECTED FROM A PHYSICAL ENTITY, PROCESSED AT THE VIRTUAL LAYER, AND ACCESSED IN THE FORM OF A DT AT THE APPLICATION LAYER, IT IS EXPOSED TO SEVERAL SECURITY RISKS. TO ENSURE THE APPLICABILITY OF A DT SYSTEM, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTAND THESE SECURITY RISKS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE IS A LACK OF A FRAMEWORK THAT CAN BE USED TO ASSESS THE SECURITY OF A DT.

"A DIGITALTWIN PROVIDES A DIGITAL REPLICATION OF A PHYSICAL SYSTEM FOR REMOTE MONITORING, VIEWING, AND CONTROL OBJECTIVES. IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RESHAPE THE FUTURE OF INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES, HENCE PAVING THE WAY FOR SMARTMANUFACTURING. AUTOMATIC SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES THAT ARE ROBUST TO MEASUREMENT NOISE ARE CRITICAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-FIDELITY DIGITALTWINS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS. BY ESTABLISHING A SPARSE REGRESSION FRAMEWORK, THE SPARSE IDENTIFICATION OF NONLINEAR DYNAMICS (SINDY) ALGORITHM AUTOMATICALLY DETERMINES THE PARSIMONIOUS GOVERNING EQUATIONS FOR PHYSICAL SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME MAJOR CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH USING SINDY TO IDENTIFY DIGITALTWIN MODELS. FIRST, THE SINDY IS RESTRICTED TO SOLVING THE ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (ODE) AND PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (PDE) PROBLEMS. SECOND, MEASUREMENT NOISE MAY SIGNIFICANTLY DETERIORATE THE PERFORMANCE OF SINDY. IN THIS PAPER, THE GENERALIZED SINDY (GSINDY) ALGORITHM IS FIRST INTRODUCED TO ENLARGE THE SINDY'S APPLICABLE RANGE. THEN, THE MODIFIED GSINDY (MGSINDY) ALGORITHM IS PROPOSED, IN WHICH AN OBJECTIVE FUNCTION IS CONSTRUCTED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY IDENTIFY THE DIGITALTWIN INPUT TIME-SERIES DYNAMICS MODEL AND OUTPUT MODEL WHILE SEPARATING NOISE FROM THE NOISY INPUT. TWO NUMERICAL EXAMPLES AND ONE INDUSTRIAL CASE STUDY ARE ANALYSED TO DEMONSTRATE THE ADVANTAGES OF APPLYING THE PROPOSED MGSINDY TO CONSTRUCT DIGITALTWIN MODELS. FURTHERMORE, THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM CAN BE INTEGRATED WITH THE EXISTING SINDY-BASED ONLINE MODEL-ADJUSTING FRAMEWORKS TO BECOME ONLINE-ADJUSTABLE. © 2023",SIMULTANEOUS DIGITALTWIN IDENTIFICATION AND SIGNALNOISE DECOMPOSITION THROUGH MODIFIED GENERALIZED SPARSE IDENTIFICATION OF NONLINEAR DYNAMICS

THE TRADITIONAL MANUFACTURING ARCHITECTURE THAT CONSISTED OF HIERARCHICAL LAYERS HAS EVOLVED INTO A HIERARCHY-FREE NETWORK IN WHICH ALL THE AREAS OF A MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISE ARE INTERCONNECTED. THE FIELD DEVICES ON THE SHOP FLOOR GENERATE LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA THAT CAN BE USEFUL FOR MAINTENANCE PLANNING. PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM) APPROACHES USE THIS DATA AND HELP US IN FAULT DETECTION AND REMAINING USEFUL LIFE (RUL) ESTIMATION. ALTHOUGH THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESEARCH PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON TOOL WEAR PREDICTION AND CONDITION-BASED MONITORING (CBM), THERE IS NOT MUCH IMPORTANCE GIVEN TO THE MULTIPLE FACETS OF PHM. THIS PAPER CONDUCTS A REVIEW OF PHM APPROACHES, THE CURRENT RESEARCH TRENDS AND PROPOSES A THREE-PHASED INTEROPERABLE FRAMEWORK TO IMPLEMENT SMART PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (SPHM).

THIS PAPER DEVELOPS A NOVEL FRAMEWORK FOR EXPLORING THE ADOPTION OF INDUSTRYFOURTH TECHNOLOGIES FOR IMPROVING SROP. IT HIGHLIGHTS CURRENT BEST-PRACTICE EXAMPLES AND PRESENTS FUTURE RESEARCH PATHWAYS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS VIEWPOINT PAPER ARGUES HOW INDUSTRYFOURTH TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION CAN ENABLE EFFECTIVE SROP IN THE POST-COVID-19 ERA. ACADEMIC ARTICLES, RELEVANT GREY LITERATURE, AND INSIGHTS FROM INDUSTRY EXPERTS ARE USED TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FRAMEWORK. FINDINGS: SEVEN TECHNOLOGIES ARE IDENTIFIED THAT BRING TRANSFORMATIONAL CAPABILITIES TO SROP, I.E. BIG DATA ANALYTICS, DIGITALTWINS, AUGMENTED REALITY, BLOCKCHAIN, 3D PRINTING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS. IT IS DEMONSTRATED HOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN HELP TO IMPROVE THREE SUB-THEMES OF ORGANISATIONAL SOCIAL PERFORMANCE (EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES, HEALTH AND SAFETY, AND BUSINESS PRACTICES) AND THREE SUB-THEMES OF COMMUNITY SOCIAL PERFORMANCE (QUALITY OF LIFE AND SOCIAL WELFARE, SOCIAL GOVERNANCE, AND ECONOMIC WELFARE AND GROWTH). RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: A RESEARCH AGENDA IS OUTLINED AT THE INTERSECTION OF INDUSTRYFOURTH AND SROP THROUGH THE SIX SUB-THEMES OF ORGANISATIONAL AND COMMUNITY SOCIAL PERFORMANCE. FURTHER, THESE ARE CONNECTED THROUGH THREE OVERARCHING RESEARCH AGENDAS: “TRUST THROUGH TECHNOLOGY”, “RESPONSIBLE RELATIONSHIPS” AND “FREEDOM THROUGH FLEXIBILITY”. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: ORGANISATIONAL AGENDAS FOR INDUSTRYFOURTH AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CAN BE COMPLEMENTARY.

"SUSTAINABLE MANUFACTURING AS A CONCEPT AS WELL AS THE PRACTICES THAT ARE DEPLOYED ARE WELL ESTABLISHED IN THE LITERATURE. TOOLS THAT GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANUFACTURING TO HAVE LESS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ARE BEING DEPLOYED AND DOCUMENTED. THE POWER OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY TO ENABLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE IS WELL ESTABLISHED AND ADVANCES CONTINUE TO BE MADE. WHAT IS LESS WELL KNOWN IS HOW DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY CAN SUPPORT THE PURSUIT OF SUSTAINABLE MANUFACTURING, ESPECIALLY USING DIGITAL MODELS, SHADOWS AND TWINS. HERE A DIGITAL SIMULATION MODEL IS CONFIGURED TO ANALYSE, REPLICATE AND DRIVE THE REAL PRODUCTION RESPECTIVELY TO IMPROVE RESOURCE PRODUCTIVITY IN THE WIDEST SENSE.

"THE DIGITALTWIN (DT) IS A RELATIVELY NEW CONCEPT THAT IS FINDING INCREASED ACCEPTANCE IN INDUSTRY. A DT IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AS COMPRISING A PHYSICAL ENTITY, ITS VIRTUAL REPLICA, AND TWO-WAY DIGITAL DATA COMMUNICATIONS IN-BETWEEN. ITS PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO LEVERAGE THE PROCESS INTELLIGENCE CAPTURED WITHIN DIGITAL MODELS-OR USUALLY THEIR FASTER-SOLVING SURROGATES-TOWARDS GENERATING INCREASED VALUE FROM THE PHYSICAL ENTITIES. THE SURROGATE MODELS ARE CREATED USING MACHINE LEARNING BASED ON DATA OBTAINED FROM THE FIELD, EXPERIMENTS AND DIGITAL MODELS, WHICH MAY BE PHYSICS-BASED OR STATISTICS-BASED. ANOMALY DETECTION AND CORRECTION, AND DIAGNOSTIC CLOSED-LOOP PROCESS CONTROL ARE EXAMPLES OF HOW A PROCESS DT CAN BE DEPLOYED. IN THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY, ITS USE CAN ACHIEVE IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCT QUALITY AND PROCESS PRODUCTIVITY. METAL ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING (AM) STANDS TO GAIN TREMENDOUSLY FROM THE USE OF DTS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE AM PROCESS IS INHERENTLY CHAOTIC, RESULTING IN POOR REPEATABILITY. HOWEVER, A DT ACTING IN A SUPERVISORY ROLE CAN INJECT CERTAINTY INTO THE PROCESS BY ACTIVELY KEEPING IT WITHIN BOUNDS THROUGH REAL-TIME CONTROL COMMANDS. CLOSED-LOOP FEEDFORWARD CONTROL IS ACHIEVED BY OBSERVING THE PROCESS THROUGH SENSORS THAT MONITOR CRITICAL PARAMETERS AND, IF THERE ARE ANY DEVIATIONS FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE OPTIMAL RANGES, SUITABLE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE TRIGGERED. THE TYPE OF CORRECTIVE ACTION (E.G. A CHANGE IN LASER POWER OR A MODIFICATION TO THE SCANNING SPEED) AND ITS MAGNITUDE ARE DETERMINED BY INTERROGATING THE SURROGATE MODELS. BECAUSE OF THEIR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)-ENDOWED PREDICTIVE CAPABILITIES, WHICH ALLOW THEM TO FORESEE A FUTURE STATE OF THE PHYSICAL TWIN (E.G.

APART FROM ASSISTING A BUILD PROCESS IN REAL-TIME, A DT CAN HELP WITH PLANNING THE BUILD OF A PART BY PINPOINTING THE OPTIMUM PROCESSING WINDOW RELEVANT TO THE DESIRED OUTCOME.

"DIGITALTWIN (DT) TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A NOVEL, FEASIBLE, AND CLEAR IMPLEMENTATION PATH FOR THE REALIZATION OF SMARTMANUFACTURING AND CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS). CURRENTLY, DT IS APPLIED TO ALL STAGES OF THE PRODUCT LIFECYCLE, INCLUDING DESIGN, PRODUCTION, AND SERVICE, ALTHOUGH ITS APPLICATION IN THE PRODUCTION STAGE IS NOT YET EXTENSIVE. SHOP-FLOOR DIGITALTWIN (SDT) IS A DIGITAL MAPPING MODEL OF THE CORRESPONDING PHYSICAL SHOP-FLOOR. HOW TO BUILD AND APPLY SDT HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHALLENGING WHEN APPLYING DT TECHNOLOGY IN THE PRODUCTION PHASE. TO ADDRESS THE EXISTING PROBLEMS, THIS PAPER FIRST REVIEWS THE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF DT, INCLUDING ITS APPLICATION STATUS IN THE PRODUCTION STAGE. THEN, AN IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND APPLICATION OF SDT IS PROPOSED. THREE KEY IMPLEMENTATION TECHNIQUES ARE EXPLAINED IN DETAIL: THE FIVE-DIMENSIONAL MODELING OF SDT; DT-BASED 3D VISUAL AND REAL-TIME MONITORING OF SHOP-FLOOR OPERATING STATUS; AND PREDICTION OF SHOP-FLOOR OPERATING STATUS BASED ON SDT USING MARKOV CHAIN. A DT-BASED VISUAL MONITORING AND PREDICTION SYSTEM (DT-VMPS) FOR SHOP-FLOOR OPERATING STATUS IS DEVELOPED, AND THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED METHOD ARE DEMONSTRATED THROUGH THE USE OF AN ENGINEERING CASE STUDY.

"SMARTMANUFACTURING EMPLOYS EMBEDDED SYSTEMS SUCH AS CNC MACHINE TOOLS, PROGRAM-ABLE LOGIC CONTROLLERS, AUTOMATED GUIDED VEHICLES, ROBOTS, DIGITAL MEASURING INSTRUMENTS, CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS, AND DIGITALTWINS. THESE SYSTEMS COLLECTIVELY PERFORM HIGH‐LEVEL COGNITIVE TASKS (MONITORING, UNDERSTANDING, DECIDING, AND ADAPTING) BY MAKING SENSE OF SENSOR SIGNALS. WHEN SENSOR SIGNALS ARE EXCHANGED THROUGH THE ABOVEMENTIONED EMBEDDED SYSTEMS, A PHENOMENON CALLED TIME LATENCY OR DELAY OCCURS. AS A RESULT, THE SIGNAL AT ITS ORIGIN (E.G., MACHINE TOOLS) AND SIGNAL RECEIVED AT THE RECEIVER END (E.G., DIGITALTWIN) DIFFER. THE TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN‐BASED CONVENTIONAL SIGNAL PROCESSING CANNOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE DELAY‐CENTRIC ISSUES. INSTEAD, THESE ISSUES CAN BE ADDRESSED BY THE DELAY DOMAIN, AS SUGGESTED IN THE LITERATURE. BASED ON THIS CONSIDERATION, THIS STUDY FIRST PROCESSES ARBITRARY SIGNALS IN TIME, FREQUENCY, AND DELAY DOMAINS AND ELUCIDATES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DELAY DOMAIN OVER TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAINS. AFTERWARD, REAL‐LIFE SIGNALS COLLECTED WHILE MACHINING DIFFERENT MATERIALS ARE ANALYZED USING FREQUENCY AND DELAY DOMAINS TO RE-CONFIRM ITS (THE DELAY DOMAIN’S) SIGNIFICANCE IN REAL‐LIFE SETTINGS. IN BOTH CASES, IT IS FOUND THAT THE DELAY DOMAIN IS MORE INFORMATIVE AND RELIABLE THAN THE TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAINS WHEN THE DELAY IS UNAVOIDABLE.

"A MODERN MATERIAL SUCH AS ALUMINIUM REQUIRES A STATE-OF-THE-ART WAY OF PRODUCTION TO ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF QUALITY. INDUSTRYFOURTH AND DIGITIZATION BRING MANY NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO THE TABLE THAT HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL TO DELIVER ADDED VALUE TO ALUMINIUM PRODUCERS. THERE ARE MANY BUZZWORDS BUT ONLY A FEW SOLUTIONS AND EVEN LESS THAT CONSIDER WIDE AND BROAD OPTIMIZATIONS AND CONSIDER THE LARGER CONTEXT OF ALUMINIUM PRODUCTION. SUCCESSFULLY RUNNING ALUMINIUM PRODUCTION REQUIRES A TEAM OF SOLUTIONS WORKING TOGETHER, AND A STRONG TEAM NEEDS A CAPTAIN TO LEAD THEM TO A COMMON GOAL. IN OUR VIEW, THIS CAPTAIN IS AN INTEGRATED PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (PMS). A SOLUTION THAT COVERS THE ENTIRE ALUMINIUM PRODUCTION PROCESS WITH AN INTEGRATED FACTORY MODEL THAT PROVIDES UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO ALL PRODUCTION AND QUALITY DATA - REAL TIME WITH ANY DETAIL NEEDED - A DIGITALTWIN. WITH THE PROCESS CONTEXT OF A STATE-OF-THE-ART PMS, DIGITIZATION CAN UNFOLD ITS FULL POTENTIAL AND REVEAL TREASURES IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY. ONE EXAMPLE IS THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODELLING IN THE CONTEXT OF QUALITY PREDICTION. BASED ON THE COMPLETE MATERIAL, QUALITY AND PROCESS DATA FROM A PMS, INCLUDING THE COMPLETE MATERIAL GENEALOGY, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODELS CAN BE TRAINED TO PRECISELY PREDICT POTENTIAL DEFECTS IN THE SUBSEQUENT PRODUCTION STEPS.

AT THE SAME TIME, THE FUNCTIONAL COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEMS TO BE DEVELOPED INCREASES AND THEY ACT OPERATIONALLY AS INDEPENDENT CPSS.

"THE CONCEPT OF DIGITALTWIN (DT) IS INCREASINGLY GETTING ATTENTION DUE TO ITS SUPPORT FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AS PART OF INDUSTRYFOURTH. A CORE COMPONENT OF A DT IS THE VIRTUAL ENTITY (VE) THAT IS MEANT TO `MIRROR' THE PHYSICAL ENTITY (PE). A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE FOR DEVELOPING THIS VE IS THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT MODELS THAT TYPICALLY MAKE UP SUCH A VE. THESE MODELS, COVERING DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES OR ASPECTS OF A SYSTEM, COMMONLY ARE DEVELOPED BY DIFFERENT ENGINEERS AND EXPRESSED IN DIFFERENT FORMALISMS GIVEN THEIR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. THIS MAKES INTEGRATION BETWEEN THESE MODELS AND FORMALISMS A CHALLENGE. SUCH INTEGRATION HAS TWO ASPECTS: THE COMMUNICATION AMONG THE MODELS, AND THEIR ORCHESTRATION, WHICH CONCERNS THE ORDER OF MODEL STEP EXECUTION AND DATA EXCHANGE.
