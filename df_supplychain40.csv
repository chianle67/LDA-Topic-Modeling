INDUSTRYFOURTH TECHNOLOGIES DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON SCRES, BUT ON RESILIENCE ELEMENTS SUCH AS FLEXIBILITY, REDUNDANCY, VISIBILITY, AGILITY, COLLABORATION, ROBUSTNESS, AND INFORMATION SHARING. THIS PAPER AIMS TO INVESTIGATE WHICH OF THE INDUSTRYFOURTH TECHNOLOGIES CAN HELP IMPROVE THE KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIS) THAT ARE USED FOR CREATING A RESILIENT SUPPLYCHAINFOURTH. A NON-SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW HAS BEEN CONDUCTED FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF (A) THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS OF SCRES, (B) THE INDUSTRYFOURTH TECHNOLOGIES THAT IMPROVE THE SCRES ELEMENTS, AND (C) THE KPIS THAT ENHANCE SCRES. A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY WHICH OF THE INDUSTRYFOURTH TECHNOLOGIES HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE KPIS THAT ENHANCE SCRES. THE FINDINGS OF THIS WORK DEMONSTRATE THAT INDUSTRYFOURTH TECHNOLOGIES CAN HELP IMPROVE THE KPIS FOR A RESILIENT SUPPLYCHAINFOURTH.",SUSTAINABILITY,MDPI,THE IMPACT OF INDUSTRY 40 TECHNOLOGIES ON KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS FOR A RESILIENT SUPPLYCHAINFOURTH,2023
SUPPLYCHAIN DYNAMICS; DIGITALTWIN; DIGITALSUPPLYCHAIN; ARTIFICIAL; INTELLIGENCE; ANYLOGISTIX,"DIGITALTWINS BECAME OF GREATER INTEREST TO RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS IN SUPPLYCHAIN AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT (SCOM). LITERATURE HAS ADDRESSED THE NEED TO UNDERSTAND DIGITALTWINS IN SCOM, MOSTLY FOCUSING ON FRAGMENTED TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND USE CASES. WE START WITH AN INTEGRATIVE LITERATURE REVIEW TO DETERMINE WHICH ELEMENTS BELONG TO RESEARCH ON DIGITALTWINS IN SCOM. WE DEFINE THE SEVEN MAJOR ELEMENTS OF A DIGITALTWIN IN SCOM: TECHNOLOGY, PEOPLE, MANAGEMENT, ORGANISATION, SCOPE, TASK, AND MODELLING. WE ALSO DISTINGUISH FIVE MAJOR TYPES OF DIGITALTWINS IN SCOM: PRODUCT, PROCESS, ORGANISATION, SUPPLYCHAIN AND NETWORK-OF-NETWORKS. ILLUSTRATION OF A SCOM DIGITALTWIN IS PROVIDED USING AN ANYLOGISTIX EXAMPLE. WE CONCLUDE THAT DIGITALTWINS IN SCOM ARE NOT MERELY A SIMULATION-BASED REPLICA OF A REAL OBJECT BUT A COMPLEX SOCIO-TECHNICAL PHENOMENON INVOLVED IN CONTINUOUS HUMAN-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE INTERACTIONS. THIS LEADS TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF DIGITALTWINS THROUGH THE LENS OF INDUSTRY 5.0, RECONFIGURABLE AND VIABLE SUPPLYCHAINS. RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS ALIKE CAN USE OUR FRAMEWORK TO STRUCTURE THE KNOWLEDGE ON SCOM DIGITALTWINS AND CONSIDER ALL SEVEN ELEMENTS WHEN DESIGNING AND USING DIGITALTWINS.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH,TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD,CONCEPTUALISATION OF A 7ELEMENT DIGITALTWIN FRAMEWORK IN SUPPLYCHAIN AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT,2023
INDUSTRYFOURTH; REFINED SUPPLYCHAIN; MULTI-OBJECTIVE CONSTRAINT;; LOGISTICS DISTRIBUTION; HONEY BADGER ALGORITHM; CUBIC MAPPING MECHANISM,"IN THE CONTEXT OF INDUSTRYFOURTH AND BASED ON THE DEMAND OF DIGITAL LOGISTICS CONSTRUCTION OF INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES, THIS PAPER INTEGRATES THE CONCEPT OF DIGITALTWIN INTO REFINED LOGISTICS SUPPLYCHAIN CONSTRUCTION. CONSIDERING THE CONSTRAINTS OF MULTI-DISTRIBUTION CENTER, HETEROGENEOUS VEHICLE PERFORMANCE, DISTRIBUTION COST, QUASI-SHIPMENT CERTIFICATE AND HUMANIZED MANAGEMENT, REFINED LOGISTICS SUPPLYCHAIN SYSTEM (RLSCS) AND CROSS-REGIONAL SCHEDULING OPTIMIZATION MODEL OF LOGISTICS VEHICLES WITH MULTI-DISTRIBUTION CENTER WERE ESTABLISHED. THE DESIGNED MODEL CAN MINIMIZE THE TRANSPORTATION COST, REDUCE THE TRANSPORTATION TIME, AND IMPROVE THE VEHICLE LOAD RATE. AN ADAPTIVE ELITE HONEY BADGER TARGET ALGORITHM BASED ON CUBIC MAPPING MECHANISM (IHBA), IS DESIGNED TO SOLVE THE MODEL. FURTHER, PERFORMANCE EVALUATION BY OPTIMIZING TEST FUNCTIONS, THE CONVERGENCE PERFORMANCE OF IHBA ALGORITHM WAS DEMONSTRATED. FINALLY, THE SIMULATION EXPERIMENT IS CARRIED OUT ACCORDING TO THE ACTUAL BUSINESS DATA AND IT IS COMPARED TO EIGHT OTHER OPTIMISTIC ALGORITHMS. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM IS MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE ROBUST, AND THE RELATED MODELS AND ALGORITHMS CAN PROVIDE RESEARCH BASIS FOR INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS DIGITALSUPPLYCHAIN SYSTEM.",IEEE ACCESS,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,AN AUXILIARY MODEL OF INTELLIGENT LOGISTICS DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT FOR MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY BASED ON REFINED SUPPLYCHAIN,2023
DIGITALSUPPLYCHAINTWINS; LOGISTICS AND SUPPLYCHAIN MANAGEMENT;; DIGITALTWIN; LOGISTICS; SUPPLYCHAIN MANAGEMENT; ORGANIC FOOD SUPPLY; CHAINS; AGENT-BASED SIMULATION; DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION,"BACKGROUND: DIGITALSUPPLYCHAINTWINS (DSCT) ARE GAINING INCREASED ATTENTION IN ACADEMIA AND PRACTICE AND THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT ON LOGISTICS AND SUPPLYCHAIN MANAGEMENT (LSCM) PERFORMANCE IS OFTEN HIGHLIGHTED. STILL, LSCM EXECUTIVES ARE HESITANT REGARDING DSCT IMPLEMENTATION. ONE REASON IS THE DIFFICULTY OF MAKING A REASONABLE COST-BENEFIT COMPARISON, BECAUSE THE BENEFITS OF USING A DSCT ARE RARELY QUANTIFIED. MOREOVER, THERE SEEMS TO BE NO METHOD OF QUANTIFYING THESE BENEFITS AS OF TODAY. METHODS: THIS ARTICLE BUILDS UPON AN EXTENSIVE SIMULATION STUDY OF A CONSTRUCTED ORGANIC FOOD SUPPLYCHAIN (FSC), CONTAINING AS MANY AS 40 SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS. IN THIS SIMULATION STUDY, THREE VOLATILITY SCENARIOS IN THE FSC WERE SIMULATED AND THEIR EFFECTS ON LSCM PERFORMANCE WERE MEASURED. SUBSEQUENTLY, DYNAMIC SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS WERE RUN TO EMULATE DSCT USE. THE BENEFITS OF USING A DSCT WERE THEN QUANTIFIED USING A NEWLY DEVELOPED APPROACH. RESULTS: A CONCLUSIVE METHOD FOR QUANTIFYING THE BENEFITS OF USING A DSCT IS PRESENTED AND VALIDATED. MOREOVER, THE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USING A DSCT FOR THE MULTI-ECHELON INVENTORY MANAGEMENT OF AN ORGANIC FSC IS GIVEN. CONCLUSIONS: THE STUDY LEADS TOWARDS A METHOD FOR QUANTIFYING THE USE OF DSCTS THAT IS OF IMPORTANCE FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE ALIKE. FOR MANAGERS, IT ADDITIONALLY PROVIDES AN EXEMPLARY APPLICATION OF SAID METHOD IN THE CONTEXT OF ORGANIC FSCS.",LOGISTICS-BASEL,MDPI,QUANTIFYING THE BENEFITS OF DIGITALSUPPLYCHAINTWINSA SIMULATION STUDY IN ORGANIC FOOD SUPPLYCHAINS,2022
